Joke entries are allowed.</p><p>Flash</p><p>Type: Electric / Normal (Extreme Speed STAB)</p><p>Ability: Speed Boost (Gotta go Fast Gotta go Faster Faster Fasterfasterfaster!)</p><p>Moves: Extreme Speed / Double Team / Volt Switch / Quick Guard</p><p>Stats: Godlike Speed and great Attack, but low stats otherwise.</p><p>Strategy: Exploit the obvious advantages of priority to disorientate opponents.</p><p>Hulk</p><p>Type: Fighting / Poison (Radiation)</p><p>Ability: Anger Point or Hustle or Huge Power</p><p>Moves: Rock Smash / Earthquake / Frustration / Bulk Up</p><p>Stats: Godlike Attack and Extreme Health and Defense. Trash Special.</p><p>Strategy: Use Attack-boosting moves or abilities to outlast and overpower other physical combatants.</p><p>Sidenote: Immortal Hulk can be a regional variant (from hell) that specializes more in Health and is Dark instead of Poison. Would be able to spam Recover and use Dark moves.</p><p>Wolverine</p><p>Type: Normal (he wasn't born with his metal) / Steel</p><p>Ability: Steadfast or Sturdy or Anger Point</p><p>Moves: Metal Claw / Swords Dance / Thrash (Berserker Mode) / Recover / Amnesia</p><p>Stats: Gamebreaking Defense and Attack. Meh Special.</p><p>Strategy: Focus primarily on attacking while occasionally using Recover to continue the fight longterm. Avoid anyone Steel types with Magnetpull.</p><p>Magneto</p><p>Type: Steel / Electric or Psychic</p><p>Ability: Magnet Pull</p><p>Moves: Flash Cannon or Steel Beam / Reflect / Magnet Rise / Magnetic Flux</p><p>Stats: Legendary Special. Meh Physical and Health.</p><p>Strategy: Magneto 1 on 1 is powerful but inflexible. He is somewhat effective at supporting his team.</p><p>Deadpool (please note, this entry is mostly a joke)</p><p>Type: Dragon / Fairy (THE BEST TYPES FOR THE BEST HERO)</p><p>Ability: Reckless or Regenerator</p><p>Moves: Attract / Swagger / Taunt / Teleport / Recover / Kartana’s sword moves / Shoyuken</p><p>Stats: Gamebreaking HP but Meh Defense. Imagine Blissey, but actually has a Good Attack stat.</p><p>Strategy: Be as obnoxious as possible while avoiding getting knocked out to wear down opponents. Still have enough offensive power to dominate the noobs and plebs.</p><p>Spiderman</p><p>Type: Bug (maybe Fighting for the secondary type)</p><p>Ability: Swarm (a lot of spider Pokemon have this already)</p><p>Moves: Sticky Web / Silk Trap / String Shot / Detect (Spidey Sense) / High Jump Kick / Taunt / First Impression or Lunge or U-turn or Pounce</p><p>Stats: Good balanced stats, with a slight focus on offense. Meh Special Attack.</p><p>Strategy: Adapt between either being offensive or wearing down your opponent with webs.</p><p>Fat Buu</p><p>Type: Dark / Fairy</p><p>Ability: Truant or Gluttony</p><p>Moves: Rest / Hyper Voice (Vice Shout) / Healing Bell / Play Rough / Faint Attack or Sucker Punch / Body Slam / Mimick or Copycat</p><p>Stats: Godlike HP.

She wants to avoid taking damage as much as she can.</p><p>Superman</p><p>Type: Steel (Man of Steel) / Flying</p><p>Ability: Chlorophyll or Protosynthesis or Solar Power or Justified</p><p>Moves: Fly /Strength / Synthesis (Healing Factor) / Superpower (Solar Flare) / Foresight (Super Vision) / Solar Beam (Heat Vision) / Bullet Punch (Faster than a…) / Extreme Speed / Iron Defense / Brave Bird (It's a bird!) / Whirlwind (Super Breath) / Icy Wind (Ice Breath) / Supersonic Sky Strike</p><p>Stats: Most stats are Godlike (superdupersuperman)</p><p>Strategy: Simply overpower opponents with his super-stats, or get an overkill boost from a teammate that knows Sunny Day.</p><p>Parasite (DC)</p><p>Type: Bug / Dark (Supervillain Type)</p><p>Ability: Rough Skin (DO NOT TOUCH Parasite) or Gluttony or Liquid Ooze</p><p>Moves: Leech Life / Strength Stap / Leech Seed / Bug Bite / Mimic / Lunge / Disable / Thunder Wave / Gastro Acid / Counter</p><p>Stats: Extreme HP.</p><p>Strategy: Drain and weaken your enemy to outlast them.</p><p>Ryu (Street Fighter)</p><p>Type: Fighting</p><p>Ability: Competitive or Rivalry</p><p>Moves: Counter or Focus Punsh (Focus Attack) / Sky Uppercut (Shoryuken) / Rapid Spin or Rolling Kick (Tatsumaki Senpukyaku) / Aura Sphere (Hadoken) / Close Combat</p><p>Stats: All stats are Good. Jack of all stats.</p><p>Strategy: Use adaptable stats and basic but flexible moves to defeat nearly any other strategy. Have issues when fighting against hammy dictator ghosts.</p><p>Sidenote: Ryu Clones are essentially the same thing but with stats and sometimes typing being altered. Users of the Satsui no Hado will have increased offense in exchange for fragility and have abilities like Dark Aura. Sakura will be a fragile speedster. Nothingness Ryu will be his Mega and have Clear Body or Inner Focus with all stats higher.</p><p>Dan Hibiki</p><p>Type: Normal / Dark (due to being somewhat influenced by Satsui no Hado, and to have 4x weakness to Fighting attacks)</p><p>Ability: Truant or Slow Start</p><p>Moves: Taunt / Splash / Tackle / Last Resort (combos well with Splash!) / Bounce (Taunt Jump)</p><p>Stats: Trash in everything. Give him the worst stats of Magikarp and Shuckle to make THE ULTIMATE LIFEFORM.</p><p>Strategy: Taunt, and hope that the enemy screws up.</p><p>Jeremy Hillary Boob</p><p>Type: ??? / Bird</p><p>Ability: Traunt or Serene Grace or Friend Guard</p><p>Moves: Present / Bestow / Celebrate / Splash / Trick Room / Sing</p><p>Stats: 68 HP / 60 Attack / 70 Defense / 64 Sp. Attack / 102 Sp. Defense / Speed 4</p><p>Sidenote: Jeremy's stats are Beatles references. Try to guess them all! HP, Attack, and Defense are all dates. Specials are song references.</p><p>Light / Kira</p><p>Type: Dark</p><p>Ability: Infiltrator or Pressure</p><p>Moves: Perish Song / Destiny Bond / Guillotine / Taunt / Scary Face / Memento / Final Gambit</p><p>Stats: Slightly defensive.</p><p>Strategy: Use unconventional instant ko tactics to compensate for low stats and inability to fight in standard combat. You need big brain to win.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy1tMSyZJqqlWK9sLfEpqanZmNlfnqDlWinqKukYoR4fpdya3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
