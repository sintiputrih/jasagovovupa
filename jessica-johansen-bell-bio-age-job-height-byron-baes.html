But I will watch the entire thing,” a fan wrote.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, this wasn’t Byron Bay’s first criticism. Back when the show was still being filmed, locals began raising their voices in “alarm, disgust, and outrage” that the production flouted filming and environmental protocols. They alleged that the show presented a glossy and false impression of the place and cast out-of-towners as locals.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Producer, Paul Franklin acknowledges the local’s anger but shared they “got a lot of positive feedback too.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, Jessica feels the same. “It wasn’t going to be a life-threatening situation. People might be angry about it and then see it, and maybe not be angry,” she explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for the question, if the show’s scripted or not — two participants Saskia Wotton and Sarah Tangye, vouched that the show was 100% organic.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Jessica in the inaugural season of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Byron Bay</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> were co-stars — Elle Watson, Sarah Tangye, Jade Kevin Foster, Simba Ali, Elias Chigros, Nathan Favro, Alex Reid, Dave Frim, Saskia Wotton, Hannah Brauer, Cai Leplaw, Elle Watson, and Lauren Johansen Bell.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Happy to have made memories on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Byron Bay</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Jessica wrote over IG on Feb 23, “So lucky to be able to create these memories with my sister by my side.”</span></p><h3><b>Jessica Johansen-Bell Relationship Status</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jessica Johansen-Bell was in a relationship with his boyfriend named Adam when she appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Byron Bay</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>They two were in a relationship before Jan 2017 and stayed strong for over 5 years.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her boyfriend, Adam was often the star of her IG, and he was even the one who first let her know the town Byron Bay won’t be happy about the show. “My partner said to me multiple times, “The town’s going to lose it over this”, but they often protest a lot of things so I wasn’t too concerned,” Jessica recalled.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Adam celebrates his birthday on June 19.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Jessica Johansen-Bell?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jessica Johansen-Bell was reportedly 26 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But she looked much younger.</span></p><h3><b>Jessica Johansen-Bell Parents</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jessica Johansen-Bell inherits Australian and Norwegian roots from her parents. Her mother, Ingrid Johansen-Beli was alive and doing well as of 2022. She just celebrated her birthday then, on Feb 12.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for her sibling, she has a sister named Lauren Johansen-Bell who co-starred with her on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Byron Baes</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>&nbsp;season 1.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her sister, Lauren is a model by profession.
