Now she is off to her next chapter.</p><p>Rayne wrapped up her commentary duties with Impact Wrestling and her last appearance was during the Hard To Kill preshow. <a href=#>She recently graduated from college </a>and took full-time job<a href=#> outside of the business.</a></p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>Ryan Boman</a>, Madison Rayne explained her decision to leave the pro wrestling world. It was not an easy one to make, but it was time to move on after accomplishing so much.</p><p>“This business… I have given it so many years of my life, but it has given infinitely more back to me. In the sense that, for the first seven years of my daughter’s life, I haven’t been sitting behind a desk, and committed to a structured schedule. And, I spent so much time with her that a lot of parents don’t get in those early years.”</p><p>“But, I think it’s time now to pivot, and to… you know, I just graduated from college in December. So, it’s time to put those student loan dollars and that degree to use.”</p><p>She is confident in her decision to leave the pro wrestling world, but she admits there are bound to be growing pains. She will miss it, but there are other ways to get that adrenaline rush.</p><p>“It will be uncomfortable, and I think there will be growing pains. I will miss it. I will have to figure out something to do. I will have to pick up – I don’t know – rock climbing, or something to get my adrenaline rush fix.”</p><p>Rayne will never <strong>totally</strong> leave the pro wrestling world. <a href=#>She is married to Impact Wrestling senor producer Josh Mathews</a>, and she spent so long in the business herself. Those lifelong friendships Rayne made in pro wrestling won’t go away just because she took a job in the “real world.”</p><p>Our best goes out to Madison Rayne as she starts this exciting new part in her life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ye49qZmpwX6KupbXSqKVmqpGuu6Z5xLGnpZmZo8Buw8eyZKyglWKxpq%2FInZydZaSkerOx06KpnmWWp7yuec%2BrpmavoprAtbjIp55o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
