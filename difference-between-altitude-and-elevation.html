The process of measuring <b>differences in elevation</b> is called levelling , and is a basic operation in topographical surveys.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-altitude-or-elevation-greatest></span>Where is altitude or elevation greatest?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>The answer is debatable.</b><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe>Mount Everest’s peak is the <b>highest altitude</b> above mean sea level at 29,029 feet [8,848 meters].</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Mount Chimborazo’s peak is the furthest point on Earth from Earth’s center.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain from base to peak at more than 33,500 feet [10,210 meters].</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-calculate-altitude></span>How do I calculate altitude?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>To <b>calculate</b> pressure <b>altitude</b> without the use of an altimeter, subject approximately 1 inch of mercury for every 1,000-foot increase in <b>altitude</b> from sea level. For example, if the current local altimeter setting at a 4,000-foot <b>elevation</b> is 30.42, the pressure <b>altitude</b> would be 3,500 feet: 30.42 – 29.92 = 0.50 in.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-describe-elevation></span>How do you describe elevation?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Elevation</b> is distance above sea level. <b>Elevations</b> are usually measured in meters or feet. They can be shown on maps by contour lines, which connect points with the same <b>elevation</b>; by bands of color; or by numbers giving the exact <b>elevations</b> of particular points on the Earths surface.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-an-example-of-elevation></span>What is an example of elevation?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Elevation</b> is defined as the height above the ground or other surface, or a place or position of height. An <b>example of elevation</b> is a plane flying at 36,000 feet above the ground. An <b>example of elevation</b> is a ballet dancer leaping three feet in the air.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=whats-the-lowest-elevation-on-earth></span>What’s the lowest elevation on Earth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>The world’s <b>lowest</b> place on <b>earth</b> is the deceased Sea located in Jordan and Israel, with an <b>elevation</b> amounting to approximately 414 meters below sea level.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-lowest-country-in-the-world></span>What is the lowest country in the world?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>The Maldives – made up of a chain of nearly 1,200 mostly uninhabited islands in the Indian Ocean – is the <b>lowest country in the world</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-lowest-city-in-the-world></span>What is the lowest city in the world?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Baku is the <b>world’s lowest</b> lying capital <b>city</b><p>(In fact, it is one of only two capital <b>cities</b> with an elevation officially below sea level, the other being Amsterdam.) It is also the largest <b>city in the world</b> with an elevation below sea level.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-us-city-is-below-sea-level></span>What US city is below sea level?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>North America<table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th style=padding-left:0>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Depth</th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>1</td><td>Badwater Basin, Death Valley, California</td><td>−86 m (−282 ft)</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>2</td><td>Bombay Beach, California</td><td>−69 m (−226 ft)</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>3</td><td>Salton <b>Sea</b> Beach, California</td><td>−67 m (−220 ft)</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>4</td><td>Desert Shores, California</td><td>−61 m (−200 ft)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-lowest-elevation-city-in-america></span>What is the lowest elevation city in America?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>The <b>lowest city</b> in the <b>United States</b> in terms of <b>elevation</b> is Calipatria, formerly known as Date <b>City</b>, in California. Calipatria is found in Imperial County in the southern part of California and covers an area of just 3.72 square miles.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-lowest-elevation-in-the-usa></span>What is the lowest elevation in the USA?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Determining which state is “<b>lowest</b>” is equally problematic. California contains the Badwater Basin in Death Valley, at 282 feet (86 m) below sea level, the <b>lowest point in the United States</b>; while Florida has the <b>lowest</b> high <b>point</b>, and Delaware has the <b>lowest</b> mean <b>elevation</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-city-has-the-highest-elevation></span>Which city has the highest elevation?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>The <b>highest city</b> in the world <b>with</b> a population of more than one million <b>is</b> La Paz. The Capital of Bolivia sits 3,869 meters above sea level, and <b>is</b> more than 1,000 meters higher than the second ranked <b>city</b> – Quito.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-country-has-the-highest-altitude></span>What country has the highest altitude?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>This statistic displays the <b>countries with</b> the greatest range between their <b>highest</b> and lowest <b>elevation</b> points.

Walker Dawson La Rinconada is the <b>highest</b> human habitation in the world, and it is home to some of the most brutal living conditions known to man. It’s also an unregulated goldmine.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-grows-at-high-altitude></span>What grows at high altitude?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>High</b>–<b>altitude growing</b> seasons are short and sweet.
