All the important characters are there in real-life:<br>Ash as frustrated, disillusioned Pokemon Trainer, Misty as a hot seductive chick, the Rocket trio as ruthless criminals who use real weapons, Professor Oak, Brock etc...<br>I also think that the plot of the short trailer is intriguing and remarkably well thought-out: Pokemon battles being banned to the underground because they have turned into bloody and brutal events, the Pokemon world in the grip of a criminal organisation which seems to organize those illegal Pokemon battles and control the black market, and last but not least Ash, a maverick Pokemon trainer, who wants to put an end to all this by turning his back on Team Rocket's evil doings and taking his revenge like in those "one man against the world"- movies.<br>All in all, it's a version of Pokemon that has become gloomier and more intense and it can legitimately be called an adult answer to the fans' constat calls for a more mature show.</p><p>But on the other hand, is this really what we wanted when we called for a more adult version? Dying Pokemon, real-life weapons, and ruthless criminal that stop at nothing?:-/ Sure, Team Galactic and especially Cyrus were pretty gross and threating, too, but nevertheless I dare say they were still gentlemen who may have had their selfish goals but at least weren't as downright evil as that TR boss in the video.</p><p>Well, like I said at the beginning, it surely is a controversial video. It doesn't change the fact that it's cleverly done and worth watching though. Kudos to the actors and the director for a good performance!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyxu8qepKimXZa9sLfEpbCpq5Virm6%2BxJqjZqSZm7JuvM6knKannmK6sMLInmVqaWBuhXp7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
