Some of them are related to his career, while others are more personal. Here are some of the most notable ones:</p><p><strong>Rigging the outcomes of Tic-Tac-Dough</strong>: One of the earliest rumors about Martindale was that he was involved in rigging the outcomes of his game shows, especially Tic-Tac-Dough. The show, which aired from 1978 to 1985, featured a tic-tac-toe board with nine categories of questions. The contestants had to answer correctly to place their X or O on the board and win cash prizes. However, some viewers suspected that the questions were manipulated to favor certain contestants or create more drama. For instance, in 1980, a contestant named Thom McKee won 43 consecutive games and amassed over $300,000 in winnings, setting a record for the longest winning streak on a game show at the time. Some critics accused Martindale of giving McKee easier questions or letting him choose his preferred categories more often than his opponents. Martindale dismissed the accusations and said that McKee was simply a very smart and lucky player who knew how to play the game well.</p><p><strong>Cancelation of Debt</strong>: A more serious controversy that affected Martindale was the cancellation of his show Debt in 1998. The show, which premiered in 1996, featured contestants who had to answer trivia questions to pay off their debts. The show was praised for its originality and humor, but it also faced criticism for exploiting the financial woes of its contestants and making light of a serious social issue.

On July 10, 1954, he was showing the WHBQ studio to some friends when he realized that his colleague Dewey Phillips was getting a lot of reactions from listeners after airing a new song by Presley called “That’s All Right”.&nbsp;Martindale rushed to the studio and interviewed Presley on air, becoming one of the first people to do so. Martindale and his wife Sandy did not attend the funeral of his longtime friend Elvis Presley when the singer died on August 16, 1977. They did not want to be a part of the circus-like atmosphere surrounding the event.&nbsp;Instead, they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">visited </a>Graceland a week later and paid their respects privately.</p><p><strong>His futuristic documentary film about home life in 1999</strong>: In 1967, Martindale acted in a short futuristic documentary film about home life in the year 1999 produced by the Philco-Ford Corporation. The film was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">titled</a>&nbsp;1999 A.D.&nbsp;and it featured a nuclear family living in a modular home with a central computer that controlled various aspects of their daily life, such as health monitoring, education, cooking, and shopping.&nbsp; The film has been widely circulated on the Internet as an example of how some predictions came true while others did not.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal life</h2><p id=7>Wink Martindale is a devoted family man, who has been married twice and has four children.
