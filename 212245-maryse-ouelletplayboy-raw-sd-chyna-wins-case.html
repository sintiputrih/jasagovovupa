Female fans between the ages of 15 and 21 who would like to celebrate a quinceaÃ±era in 2008 can enter the âUltimate QuinceaÃ±eraâ Sweepstakes now by visiting holamun2.com/raw. Entries must be received between January 1 and January 30, 2008. The Sweepstakes is co-sponsored by WWE and mun2. mun2 and WWE are revving up to plan an extraordinary QuinceaÃ±era (similar to a Sweet 16 Party) to honor the tradition of los quince aÃ±os. The chosen cumpleaÃ±era (birthday girl) will receive an intimate celebration with 50 of her closest friends in the nearest major city to their residence. mun2 and WWE pull out all the stops for this quince celebration, complete with limousine, entertainment, and a special appearance by WWE Superstar Carlitoâ”¢ and WWE Diva Melinaâ”¢!, mun2 cameras will be on-hand to document the fabulous party â” covering everything from the grand entrance to the baile sorpresa â” and air the highlights on the mun2 network at a future date. âWWE RAW has consistently been one of the top rated shows on mun2,â said Lisa Hackett, VP of Marketing for mun2. âAmong Latino youth, luchadores and quinceaÃ±eras resonate as significant cultural identifiers, so the Sweepstakes offers a fun and unexpected twist to bring them together. Partnering with WWE RAW and throwing a QuinceaÃ±era for a lucky winner is an unprecedented way of blending two strong youth entertainment brands.â Known for theatrical drama, action and athleticism, the pairing of WWE RAW and lucha libre has given this facet of Latino culture a more expansive position in the United States. With heroes like Stone Cold Steve Austinâ”¢, John CenaÂ® and many others, the WWE brand has grown with its audience over the last 15 years. Successfully reaching the Latino youth audience every Wednesday on mun2 as a top rated show, the two popular brands have become essential to Latino youth entertainment.
