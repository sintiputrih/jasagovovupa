So you could imagine the shock when the internet found out a popular Vtuber,&nbsp;<strong>Kyouka</strong>&nbsp;from Overidea, is under fire due to allegations of abuse and lying to fans.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Vtubers have been on the rise lately due to their unique appearances, talent, and backstories behind the characters. So much so that people such as AmaLee created her own Vtuber persona, and companies such as Hololive rose through the ranks to become a notable vtuber talent agency.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>As Vtubers reach the same reach of popularity compared to real-life celebrities, it would come as no surprise if one of them gets called out for negative behavior, especially if it heavilly affects their mental well-being.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-overidea-vtuber-kyouka data-injectable=false>Who is Overidea VTuber Kyouka?</h2><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Kyouka is a popular Vtuber from China who founded Overidea, a multi-lingual artist group. It is also important to know that despite their appearance, Kyouka’s real-life gender is a boy. According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Overidea website</a>, Kyouka’s body was hijacked by a bird-shaped parasite called “DD bird”. A side effect of this was that their voice was lowered.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>Kyouka debuted on social media in 2018 and is mostly live on Bilibili, the Chinese version of YouTube. Their role in Overidea is the dean and president of the student union and by June 23, 20022, they’ve reached over one million subscribers on Bilibili.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is Kyouka accused of?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>On October 7, 2022, vtuber Bingtang released an hour-long video titled “Three Years of Me and Scum”. The video detailed Bingtang and Kyouka’s relationship from 2020 and how she accused Kyouka of emotional abuse and manipulating fans. She alleged that Kyouka wouldn’t make their relationship public for the sake of his fans. At the same time, Bingtang was accused by his fans at the time that they were using Kyouka for clout.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>It was also alleged that Kyouka paid sex workers, which is illegal in China, to annoy Bingtang. Kyouka claimed, however, that part of the story was made up during his response. Regardless, Bingtang was already overwhelmed by the whole situation and said she had a mental breakdown. She told Kyouka that she gave up her early 20s to be with him, only to realize that she was being deceived by her partner.</p><p>“These three years of my early 20s, the best years of my youth, were given to a scumbag. I told him ‘I am not ashamed of falling in love with you, I’m only sorry to be deceived by you,’”</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dot Esports</a>&nbsp;reported that Kyouka released a response video to the accusations. People in the vtubing community, however, didn’t believe his side of the story and accused him of passing the blame to Bingtang and her fans.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Due to these allegations, fans of Kyouka have decreased, and Bingtang’s channel was marked as “controversial” by Bilibili. Other members of Overidea and Vtubers that have worked previously with Kyouka have not left a comment on the situation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmp6aav6qwxJpkr6yll7Kzecqypq6jkWKur7CMsJ%2BarF2Wv6Z506GcsmWRmLC2v8SdZKieXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
