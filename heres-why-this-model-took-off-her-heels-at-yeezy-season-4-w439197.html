Some of the attendees complained about the conditions (it was in the high eighties!) and the late start time. After standing at attention for hours, a few of the models <a href=#>passed out on the lawn</a> of Roosevelt Island and stumbled in their shoes while storming down the runway.</p><p>But <b>Amina Blue</b>&nbsp;refused to be a potential meme. The model, who starred in a Tyga music video, did stumble … but took off her shoes to avoid a complete spill during the live stream.&nbsp;</p><p>“They were comfortable, it was the heat from the sun,” she explained to <i><a href=#>The Cut</a></i>, citing the reason why some of Yeezy’s girls lost control. “The sweat. When you’re wearing plastic shoes, your feet are going to sweat.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Her decision happened in the, well, heat of the moment. “I had, like, half-shoes on, so they just slipped off, and I couldn’t get them back on, so I took them off,” she continued. “You know, what was I going to do? It was either I was going to fall, or I was going to take my shoes off. And I felt that was the right thing to do, so I took them off and continued to walk. You know, the show has to go on.”&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, there’s no hard feelings from the <i>Life of Pablo</i> rapper. “We have a really great relationship, we’re very open with each other, so he respects anything I do, as I respect anything he does,” she said.</p><p>In fact, West ensures that by the time the shoes hit the shelves, they’ll be unbreakable. “As is the case with many fashion shows, the designs presented on the runway are often times still in the sample, prototype stage,” a Yeezy spokesperson <a href=#>told <i>WWD</i></a><i>.</i> “We take quality control very seriously and will ensure that these models undergo further, rigorous trials before reaching the consumer.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Stylish by Us Weekly</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX52ys7HSZq6hsV2ptaq%2FjKamnZ2cYsGwu8pmpp%2BeXZ2ys3nHnpylq12WwW7FxJ6xsmWjmq60u81ma2avZGiGcoWWaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
