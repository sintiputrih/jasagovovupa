To complicate matters further, she was&nbsp;also&nbsp;his fiancée, whom he jilted in favor of her handmaiden Amara. Qetsiyah — who I’ll now refer to as Tessa, just to simplify all of our lives — also created the cure, which now resides in Katherine’s bloodstream.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>As for the dreams that Elena and Katherine were having, the ones that made Damon concerned his girlfriend still had feelings for her ex, it turns out Tessa&nbsp;planted&nbsp;those in the girls’ heads.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>So, basically, there was a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;that&nbsp;<strong>Janina Gavankar&nbsp;</strong>held back in our interview. (Well played, lady.)</p><h3>Damon & Elena: Doomed To Fail?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>The Vampire Diaries&nbsp;writers giveth, and&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries&nbsp;writers taketh away. That’s officially my new mantra, now that we know Damon and Elena are literally&nbsp;destined&nbsp;not to be together. Per Tessa’s history lesson, versions of Stefan and Elena have found each other time and time again throughout each of their lives.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Destiny has been trying to get the doppelgangers together forever,” she informed him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Thankfully, Damon’s not a huge fan of destiny. He gave a big, passionate speech to Elena at the end of the episode — seriously, it put Elena’s “I’m in love with you” season finale speech to shame — declaring that he doesn’t give a flying Fell what destiny thinks; he&nbsp;is&nbsp;going to be with her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“You are my life,” he told her, at which point I basically melted into a sopping wet Andy puddle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Of course, Damon’s epic speech was kind of overshadowed by Stefan suddenly waking up and not remembering&nbsp;anything. Tessa must have done more to him than she realized when she cast that spell on Silas, because Stefan literally has “no idea” who anyone is anymore.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>(And unless the promo for next week’s episode was designed to lead us astray, which it usually is, Stefan will get a reminder of who he is… courtesy of a kiss from Elena!)</p><h3>Matt-mento</h3><p id=content-paragraph-11>Matt’s (<strong>Zach Roerig</strong>)&nbsp;storyline also went from zero to bats**t this week. We learned that when Nadia “killed” her Traveler buddy Gregor, he actually went inside Matt’s body — hence that weird eye trick he did to Matt on the season premiere.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>(Poor Matt. The only blackouts he experiences should be alcohol-related.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Honestly, this episode was so friggin’ crazy that I barely noticed we didn’t even see some of the show’s most important characters: We got no Bonnie (<strong>Kat Graham</strong>), no Jeremy (<strong>Steven R. McQueen</strong>) and no Caroline (<strong>Candice Accola</strong>). We did, however get&nbsp;two&nbsp;Ninas and Pauls, so I guess I can’t be&nbsp;too&nbsp;picky.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, does your brain hurt as much as mine does right now?
