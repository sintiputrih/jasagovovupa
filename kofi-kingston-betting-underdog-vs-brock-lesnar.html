Lesnar, on the other hand, is a 1/3 favorite to win the title.</p><p>This shouldn't come as a major surprise to anybody, and it necessarily mean that Lesnar has already been handed the victory. As everybody knows, The Beast Incarnate almost never loses his singles matches, and you almost never see him listed as an underdog.</p><p>It should be noted that Lesnar was also listed as the 8/15 favorite (h/t Ringside News), to defeat <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Rollins</a> at SummerSlam, while The Architect was an 11/8 underdog. Of course, Rollins defeated Lesnar for the second time in a four-month span to regain the title that he initially won at WrestleMania 35.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Possible Explanation For Why Brock Lesnar Is Appearing On SmackDown</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kingston1.jpg><p>Lesnar went on hiatus for a month following his loss to Rollins, and the latter successfully defended his title against Braun Strowman at Clash of Champions. Rollins is now set to put his title on the line against Bray Wyatt at the Oct. 6 Hell in a Cell pay-per-view - two days after the WWE Championship match on SmackDown.</p><p>Kingston defeated Daniel Bryan at WrestleMania 35 to become the new WWE Champion, and he's absolutely flourished as a main event star. But Lesnar promises to be Kingston's greatest challenge yet.</p><h2 id=should-kingston-lose-the-title-now><strong>Should Kingston&nbsp;Lose The Title Now?</strong></h2><p>The WWE Championship hasn't changed hands as frequently as the Universal title. Jinder Mahal's reign lasted for 170 days, but the ensuing AJ Styles reign lasted for 371 days. Daniel Bryan dethroned Styles and held it for 145 days, but Kingston has surpassed that reign and is closing in on 170 days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But even though history is on Kingston's side, Vince McMahon is never afraid to give Lesnar long-term title reigns, as we saw on Raw. It'd be a disappointment for the WWE Universe if they took the title off of Kingston now, seeing how much he's succeeded as the champion. But it wouldn't be the least bit surprising if WWE had him lose it to Lesnar, even though it's probably not what&nbsp;most of the fans want to see.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>Next: <a href=#>Buff Bagwell Told Johnny Gargano He'd Never Make It In Wrestling</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnm6SzqnnKoqWgq6Sku26uxK2roqaXYsKvsMSrm6ifXavAbq7RqJqkZZyawK%2Bt0Wg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
