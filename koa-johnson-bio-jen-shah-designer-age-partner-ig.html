He said the same happened to his other co-workers.</p><p>During his 10-month tenure with Jen, Koa designed around 12 looks for her, including her Biden-Harris dress, her cast photo dress, and reunion dress. He said those were like the most traumatizing months of his life. But still, Koa is he’s happy that someone recorded and later leaked it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jen exchanged a different story.
