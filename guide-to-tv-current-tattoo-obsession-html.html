That fondness carried over to New York Ink, L.A. Ink, London Ink, even the lukewarm Tattoo Highway. And now we get to enjoy the golden era of ink shows — it’s sort of a boom genre right now. Here’s your guide to all the tattoo TV shows currently airing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4139c0304d6ecab319103975462da1cc-3-0-0@published data-word-count=71><b>The Contest Shows</b><br><b>Best Ink</b> (Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on Oxygen) and <b>Ink Master</b> (Spike, returning later this year) are the exact same show. They might even use the same “countdown” music. And they are both terrific! It’s Top Chef, but with tattoos instead of cooking, and both shows have wonderfully harsh judges. Ink Master’s Oliver Peck might be the most exacting judge on <a href=#>any reality-contest show</a> in the current mix.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4139c0304d6ecab319103975462da1cc-4-0-0@published data-word-count=98><b>The Workplace Shows</b><br>When Miami Ink was good, it was really damn good —&nbsp;but that was before every single tattoo was a memorial or tribute tattoo. (The same thing happened on American Chopper. Must every motorcycle be a “tribute” motorcycle?) So it’s not too surprising that other shows have the same model: Workplace shenanigans, plus different clients every week. <b>Tattoos After Dark</b> (Wednesdays at 11 p.m., Oxygen) tends to have weird and attention-seeking clients, while VH1’s <b>Black Ink Crew</b> (which just finished its second season) focuses a little more on the drama of the employees and their partners.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4139c0304d6ecab319103975462da1cc-5-0-0@published data-word-count=55><b>Kitchen Nightmares, But Tattoos</b><br>That’s <b>Tattoo Rescue</b>, which is pretty much Tabitha’s Salon Takeover, but again, for tattoo parlors: Expert visits decrepit business, appropriately shames business owner, and moves on his or her merry way. Bad haircuts and crappy food are one thing, though —&nbsp;a crappy or unhygienic tattoo is permanent and potentially very dangerous.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4139c0304d6ecab319103975462da1cc-6-0-0@published data-word-count=182><b>The Bad-Tattoo Shows</b><br>To be clear, these are shows about people with terrible tattoos — and lo, they are terrible. Many of the tattoos are badly executed, but many are simply really bad ideas in the first place. TLC has <b>America’s Worst Tattoos</b>, which finished its first season in May, and that show included people with tattoos of a hot dog playing a ukulele, a merman smoking a cigarette, and several undecipherable blobs. And a guy with a “workout girl” tattoo where <a href=#>the dumbbells were instead drawn as vibrators.</a> <b>Tattoo Nightmares</b> (Spike, returning in February) is similar but slightly better, with sharper editing and less egregious phony-baloney reality-show chitchat. Plus it explains more about how cover-up tattoos work, rather than just humiliating the poor schmucks who have dumb ink. A&E’s <b>Bad Ink</b> (Mondays, 9 p.m.) falls somewhere in between, with plenty of moments of seeming authenticity but also a real fake-seeming setup in which the stars go out looking for people with bad tattoos. The biggest message of these shows, though, is clear: A staggering number of people have tattoos of penises.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Your Guide to TV’s Current Tattoo Obsession</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobWdgZnyowcidnGasn2LBt3nCrqmrnZ6perWt062mqGWfl8Cmv9KipqdmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
