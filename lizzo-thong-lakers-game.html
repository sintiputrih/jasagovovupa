Though the crowd stood up and cheered as Lizzo showed off her risque attire, cameras quickly cut back to the dancers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The “Good as Hell” singer took to her Instagram Story to defend her choice to be unapologetically confident in her skin and ask why her self-assurance with her body shape and size still unnecessarily offends others.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’m a really solid, grounded person, and I know that I’m shocking because you’ve never seen—in a long time—a body like mine doing whatever it wants to do and dressing the way that it dresses and moving the way that it moves,” said Lizzo. “I’m not going to shrink myself because somebody thinks that I’m not sexy to them.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lizzo has made it a mission to promote body positivity, confidence, and self-love to her fans in the midst of a whirlwind year for the pop star.
