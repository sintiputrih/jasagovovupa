Teen Mom 2’s <a href=#><strong>Kailyn Lowry</strong></a> hosts Coffee Convos with <strong>Lindsie Chrisley</strong> of <a href=#>Chrisley Knows Best</a>. “Kail’s is day-to-day conversational and ours is more about transforming your life and learning how to become the best version of yourself,” Messer clarified. “Even though they’re different, we love to support one another. I was on Kail’s and she was just on ours … the third episode I think.”</p><p>Viewers will likely hear from other cast members, too. “I think I’ll definitely have other Teen Mom stars and other … people that [manager] <strong>Lindsay [Rielly]</strong> and I both know on,” the reality star teased. “We have an exciting lineup of guests for the next couple of months.” The <a href=#>TV personality</a> has been collaborating with Rielly on the project for two years.</p><p>Messer previously dabbled in motivational speaking, so a podcast seemed like a natural next step. “I definitely think this is a better way … of getting into public speaking because I feel like it’s gonna reach a bigger platform versus trying to get into certain places or booking certain things,” she told Us. “This podcast is going to get out to so many people. … [There’s] just a bigger audience this way.”</p><p>Life Reboot will also incorporate Rielly’s own Live Your Standard life coaching curriculum. “It will be talking about my experiences with it and what I’m doing in my life and my goals,” Messer said.</p><p>She has seen results from the program. “I definitely feel like I was in need of knowing myself more and knowing that and truly loving who I was … and, you know, knowing where I wanted to go and it took … a lot of transformation in my life,” she explained. “Like breaking cycles that I had adapted to because that’s all I’d ever known and getting to the core of who I was.”</p><p>Messer added: “That’s my role in the podcast … It’s to share what I have [gone] through and what I’ve learned as I’ve [gone] through it and every high and low in my life, and that’s what I’m most excited to share and truly help others … that may be going through the same things.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Subscribe now at <a href=#>PodcastOne.com</a> or Apple Podcasts to get new episodes every Wednesday.&nbsp;Follow Leah and Live Your Standard on Instagram at <a href=#>@leahdawn92mtv&nbsp;</a>and <a href=#>@liveyourstandard.</a></p><p>With reporting by Carly Sloane</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuenZ5iurC5jGuqZqSVlrVuucSsqp6qXZ7AbrjArqWcoJmjtG60xKtkqK%2BeYr2wsMKaqq1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
