The <a href=#>Golden Globe Awards</a> are not always predictable, despite the intensive guessing games some play leading up to the annual ceremony. In fact, the awards show delivered <a href=#>major surprises and snubs</a> during its decades-long history.</p><p>Each year gives fans and industry folks names left off the nominations roster or an upset, but some are the kind of moments that will never be forgotten.
