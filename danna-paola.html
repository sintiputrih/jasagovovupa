She had previously appeared in Elle-Mexico and Badhombre magazines. She was named the new face of L’Orela Paris’s hair color line in the Latin American market in 2016.</p><p><strong>The Elite star weighs 50 kilograms (110 pounds) and has body measurements of 32-24-35 inches.</strong></p><h2><span id=Danna_Paola_Is_She_Married_Boyfriend_Relationship_History>Danna Paola Is She Married? Boyfriend, Relationship History</span></h2><p>Danna Paola had four publicized relationships and rumors, according to her relationship history.</p><p>She dated Eleazor Gomez, co-star of Atrévete a Soar (2009), since 2009. Eleazor was over 30 years old, so he didn’t consider coming out as a couple in public due to the age difference. The relationship lasted nearly 5 years before ending in 2014.</p><p>Danna was heartbroken after her relationship ended. However, actor Eugenio Siller entered her life and brought her comfort. The couple met on the set of Quién es quién? The relationship lasted only a short time before they split up.</p><p>In 2018, the “Oye Pablo” songstress was rumored to be dating her Elite co-star Miguel Bernardaeau, but there was no confirmation from either of them. She has been rumored to be in a relationship with Chilean actor Jorge Lopez since 2019. However, by the end of 2019, she claimed she was single and content, dismissing the romantic rumor between the two.</p><p>Danna Paola and Itzan Escamilla were also on the scene. She captioned a photo of two with “My itzanlaurant love u” on her Instagram account. It went unconfirmed, just like a few of her previous relationships. So, if the relationship had lasted, Danna could have exchanged wedding vows with Eleazor Gomez. Aside from that, she hasn’t been in a relationship long enough to see herself marrying.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Shauna O’Brien</a></h3>Shauna O'Brien estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
