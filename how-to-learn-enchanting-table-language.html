While <b>Minecraft’s enchanting table language</b> isn’t actually new, as the alphabet dates back to 2001 and hails from the classic Commander Keen PC game, there’s a renewed interest in understanding it.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-language-is-the-minecraft-enchanting-table></span>What language is the minecraft enchanting table?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>The arcane glyphs that float from bookshelves to the <b>enchanting table</b> and the cryptic runes in the <b>enchanting table’s</b> interface are written in the Standard Galactic Alphabet, which is a simple alphabet substitution cipher used in the Commander Keen series of computer games.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-make-my-enchantment-table-better></span>How do I make my enchantment table better?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>In order to receive higher level <b>enchantments</b> in the <b>enchanting</b> menu, you must place bookshelves around the <b>table</b>. The highest level <b>enchantment</b> is level 30 (introduced in Minecraft 1.3), is only possible with 15 bookshelves placed one block away from the <b>table</b> in a 1 high, 5 by 5 square, with an opening for a door.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-bookshelves-do-you-need-for-level-50></span>How many bookshelves do you need for Level 50?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Placing <b>bookshelves</b> will allows you to use higher <b>level</b> enchantments, up to <b>level 50</b>, which means up to 30 <b>bookshelves</b> can be placed around your table.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-make-a-max-level-enchantment-table></span>How do you make a max level enchantment table?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-bookshelves-do-you-need-for-silk-touch></span>How many bookshelves do you need for silk touch?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Looking at the first table, it can be seen that at least 9 <b>bookshelves</b> are required to get <b>Silk Touch</b> in at least the third slot (the number of <b>bookshelves</b> where all the possible levels will be greater than or equal to 17). <b>I</b> also found that the number of <b>bookshelves</b> is the base enchantment level ÷ 2 rounded up.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-books-are-needed-for-15-bookshelves></span>How many books are needed for 15 bookshelves?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>In order to create <b>15 bookshelves</b>, plus the one <b>book</b> for the table, you’ll need 46 Leather.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-get-fortune-3></span>How do you get fortune 3?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>As long as the third enchantment in the table has a 30 on it, you’re good to go. You can enchant wooden shovels (or any other throwaway item) with the top enchantment to effectively “skip” the bottommost one if it’s not what you want. If you do this enough, eventually you’ll <b>get fortune 3</b> in the bottom one.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-fortune-do-on-an-axe></span>What does fortune do on an AXE?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Using the <b>axe</b>, enchanted with <b>Fortune</b>, on leaves will increase the odds of getting more saplings & sticks. Its use on all kinds of vines also increases the odds of getting a higher drop rate. <b>Fortune</b> III, the highest level of <b>Fortune</b>, guarantees a 100% chance of receiving a drop when used on the <b>axe</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-fortune-3-give-more-xp></span>Does Fortune 3 give more XP?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Fortune</b> is an enchantment applied to mining and digging tools that increases the amount and/or chances of specific item drops. It <b>does</b> not increase experience drops.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-get-a-fortune-3-villager></span>Can you get a fortune 3 villager?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Yes <b>you can</b>. Some stuff <b>you can</b>‘t but <b>Fortune 3</b> isn’t <b>one</b> of them. Usually <b>if you can</b>‘t <b>get</b> it it’s a level 5 enchanted book and <b>you have</b> to <b>make</b> it by combining two level 4s. Or <b>you can get</b> the book by trading with Librarian <b>villagers</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-a-librarian-have-fortune-3></span>Can a librarian have fortune 3?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Fortune III</b> book is more available from the <b>librarians</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-rare-is-a-mending-villager></span>How rare is a mending villager?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>When a vendor unlocks a book, there is an equal chance it could be any one. Each vendor can unlock 3 book trades. This means, on average, you will find a <b>mending</b> trade for every 10 librarians you fully unlock.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-get-an-unbreaking-3-villager></span>Can you get an Unbreaking 3 villager?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Make</b> a <b>villager</b> trading post, keep breaking and replacing the lectern until <b>you get unbreaking III</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-unbreaking-3-last-forever></span>Does Unbreaking 3 last forever?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>This shows that an <b>Unbreaking III</b> Diamond Pick will <b>last</b>, on average, about 6,144 uses (four times as <b>long</b> as a normal Diamond Pick.) However there is also a chance it will break after only 6,000 uses. Similarly, there is a chance it will <b>last</b> for 6,500 uses.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-cheapest-unbreaking-3-trade></span>What is the cheapest Unbreaking 3 trade?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>11 is the absolute <b>cheapest</b> base price for level <b>3</b> enchantments. specifically, 5-19 emeralds for a level 1 enchantment, 8-32 for a level 2, 11-45 for a level <b>3</b>, 14-58 for a level 4, and 17-71 for a level 5, though its actually capped at 64.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-get-unbreaking-4></span>Can you get Unbreaking 4?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>You can</b> actually <b>get unbreaking 4</b> through commands. When on tools, this level <b>would make</b> it to where every use on the tool <b>would</b> only <b>have</b> a 20% chance of using durability. And because of the formula no <b>unbreaking</b> level <b>would</b> be completely unbreakable.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-mending-better-than-unbreaking></span>Is mending better than Unbreaking?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Mending</b> is <b>better than unbreaking</b> on any tool, weapon, or armor except bows. Bows will want infinity and <b>mending</b> conflicts with infinity.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-highest-unbreaking-level></span>What is the highest Unbreaking level?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>The <b>maximum level</b> for the <b>Unbreaking</b> enchantment is <b>Level</b> 3. This means that you can enchant an item with up to <b>Unbreaking</b> III.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-chances-of-getting-an-unbreaking-3-villager></span>What are the chances of getting an Unbreaking 3 villager?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Probability</b> calculation: assuming that a librarian has a 2/<b>3 chance of having</b> a 1st tier enchanted book trade, and that enchantment is chosen randomly from the 37 different available enchantments before choosing an enchantment level, and then the level of enchantment is selected randomly, there is a 2/333 <b>probability</b><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-get-an-efficiency-5-villager></span>Can you get an efficiency 5 villager?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Basically yes. <b>You</b> need to check what <b>they</b>‘re initially selling and then remove the lectern and place a new <b>one</b> and check again. Every once in a while <b>they</b> will sell some potent stuff, i.e. lots of level <b>V</b> enchantments.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6rbHAq6VmnZ6YtaK606KloGWklq%2BtsYylmKefpZa0pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
