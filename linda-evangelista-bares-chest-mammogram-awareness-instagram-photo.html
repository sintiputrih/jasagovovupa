Thank you, Linda! #girlpower,” another added. “Good on you @lindaevangelista for being so vulnerable in sharing your entire life story,” someone else wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Evangelista went public with her breast cancer journey in an interview this September with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.wsj.com/style/fashion/linda-evangelista-steven-meisel-32909b7b?ns=prod/accounts-wsj" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="WSJ.

A routine mammogram in 2018 first uncovered ductal carcinoma in situ, an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/treatment/treatment-of-breast-cancer-by-stage/treatment-of-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-dcis.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="early form of breast cancer" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">early form of breast cancer</a>, for which she underwent a bilateral mastectomy. In 2020, she learned the cancer had returned, after discovering a lump in her pectoral muscle. Treatment continued with more surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She is outspoken about her experience now, but kept it private in real time. “Only a handful of people knew. And I’m just not one of those people who has to share everything,” Evangelista said. “I thought to myself, ‘I will share this one day, but while I am going through it, absolutely not. I don’t want the Daily Mail waiting outside my door like they do every time something happens.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Evangelista said her current prognosis is “good” in an October interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/TheView/status/1715071869752123435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1715071869752123435%7Ctwgr%5E081710e71a3e4bb1fb1b4ad54cd9523d5f256a43%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeople.com%2Fembed%3Furl%3Dhttps3A2F2Fx.com2FTheView2Fstatus2F17150718697521234353Fs3D20id%3Dmntl-sc-block_1-0-26-iframeoptions%3De303DdocId%3D8364120" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The View" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The View</a>, and added that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.breastcancer.org/screening-testing/oncotype-dx data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oncotype DX genetic testing" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Oncotype DX genetic testing</a> revealed her chances for recurrent cancer were high—which is why she underwent multiple forms of treatment after it was found the second time.</p><img alt="new york, new york september 12 linda evangelista attends the kering caring for women dinner at the pool on september 12, 2023 in new york city photo by raymond hallgc images" title="Linda Evangelista Just Posted a Mammogram Selfie" width=1997 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1677946171-657a208360de6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Raymond Hall</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Everybody’s story’s going to be nuanced,” she told hosts <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.prevention.com/life/a45630772/the-view-whoopi-goldberg-fgi-american-icon-award-2023-instagram/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Whoopi Goldberg" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Whoopi Goldberg</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.prevention.com/life/a44565450/the-view-cast-joy-behar-dog-bernie-missing-reaction/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joy Behar" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Joy Behar</a>. “And mine ended up being, ‘We’ll just get it out and give you some radiation.’ But I had a really bad Oncotype score. It’s a score that tells you your probability of getting the cancer again. They take into account many many things, including genetics. But mine was bad.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, Evangelista is on medication to ideally lower the odds of the cancer’s return. “I’m on fantastic meds for five years; they make you feel so good,” she said sarcastically. “They’re horrible. They’re hormone suppressors. They make you feel old.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But she’ll take feeling old if that means staying alive. “I know I have one foot in the grave, but I’m totally in celebration mode,” she told WSJ. “I’m so happy to be alive. Anything that comes now is bonus.”</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d352bf51-1681-4b9e-bb5d-839933996a5c_1699308618.jpg alt="Headshot of Kayla Blanton" title="Headshot of Kayla Blanton" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Kayla Blanton is a freelance writer-editor who covers health, nutrition, and lifestyle topics for various publications including Prevention, Everyday Health, SELF, People, and more.
