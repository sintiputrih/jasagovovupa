This clue has appeared several times in different puzzles, and each time it has a different answer. How is that possible? Let’s find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Geography of Saudi Arabia</strong></h2><p>Saudi Arabia is a large country in the Middle East, occupying most of the Arabian Peninsula. It shares borders with eight other countries: Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, and Jordan. It also has a coastline along the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.</p><p>According to the New York Times website<a href=# rel=noopener>1</a>, the crossword puzzle uses the standard American atlas as its reference for geographic names and boundaries. This means that any country that is adjacent to Saudi Arabia on the map can be considered as its neighbor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Variations of the Clue</strong></h2><p>The clue “Neighbor of Saudi Arabia” has appeared in the NYT crossword at least five times since 2020, and each time it has a different five-letter answer. Here are the dates and answers of those puzzles:</p><ul><li>July 6, 2023: YEMEN</li><li>May 5, 2022: YEMEN</li><li>April 16, 2023: YEMEN</li><li>August 10, 2023: QATAR</li><li>April 17, 2023: OMAN</li></ul><p>As you can see, Yemen is the most common answer for this clue, appearing three times out of five. This makes sense, as Yemen is the largest and southernmost neighbor of Saudi Arabia. However, Qatar and Oman are also valid answers, as they are also neighboring countries of Saudi Arabia.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Difficulty of the Clue</strong></h2><p>The clue “Neighbor of Saudi Arabia” is not an easy one to solve, as it requires some knowledge of geography and some logic. The clue does not specify which side or direction of Saudi Arabia to look at, so it could be any of its eight neighbors. Moreover, the clue does not give any hints or indicators about the length or structure of the answer, so it could be any five-letter word that fits the grid.</p><p>The difficulty of the clue also depends on the context and theme of the puzzle. For example, in the puzzle from August 10, 2023<a href=# rel=noopener>2</a>, the answer QATAR was part of a theme related to countries that host major sporting events. In that case, QATAR was easier to guess than other possible answers. However, in other puzzles, the answer might not have any connection to the theme or other clues, making it harder to figure out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Appeal of the Clue</strong></h2><p>The clue “Neighbor of Saudi Arabia” is a clever and challenging one that tests the solver’s knowledge and skills. It is also a versatile and flexible clue that can have different answers depending on the puzzle and the date. It is a clue that keeps the solver guessing and engaged until they find the right answer.</p><p>The clue also reflects the diversity and complexity of the world we live in. It shows that there are many countries and regions that have different cultures, histories, and relationships with each other. It also shows that there are many ways to look at and understand geography and maps.</p><p>The clue “Neighbor of Saudi Arabia” is a crossword clue that stumped many solvers over the years. It is a clue that challenges and entertains crossword lovers around the world. It is a clue that deserves respect and admiration from both solvers and constructors alike.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfo7Kqs8ebpqtln5t6tK3UnaBmmaKWr6qtjKewrWWRYrCzu9KsrqiqlGKwrcHEZquhmaRiwLXBzKmcnWWdlru6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
