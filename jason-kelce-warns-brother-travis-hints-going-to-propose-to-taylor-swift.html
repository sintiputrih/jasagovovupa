As Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce get more and more serious, fans begin to wonder what the future will hold for them. The couple has been very open about how happy they are, but they haven't encouraged any rumors of their specific plans for their future together.</p><p>Travis Kelce usually talks about his relationship on "New Heights", the podcast he hosts with his brother, because unlike in a normal interview, he knows Jason won't overstep boundaries or put him on the spot. <strong>Likewise, in that comfortable environment, he might slip and say things that will come back to haunt him</strong>.</p><p>In the latest episode, they were talking about NBA star Victor Wembanyama, who is over 7 feet tall, and Travis said "You can't tell me that dude wasn't made in a f**king lab over there in France."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>So far so good, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">then he added</a> "Lab-grown diamonds, that’s a lab-grown f**king NBA player. Can't wait til I f**kin’ make one.</strong>"</p><p><strong>Jason immediately realized how that sounded. What will fans think when hearing that he's looking forward to getting a diamond? "Don’t do this. Do not give any of these other conspiracy theorists anything else to latch onto, please," he begged, but it was already too late</strong>.</p><p>Posts about this flooded social media within minutes of people hearing what Travis said, and engagement rumors are now buzzing once again.</p><h2 id=travis-and-taylor-swift-39-s-family-are-rooting-for-them>Travis And Taylor Swift's Family Are Rooting For Them</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-kiss.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While both the Swift and the Kelce family respectfully refrained from commenting too much, <strong>it's no secret that they're rooting for the couple</strong>. They've had nothing but good things to say about them, and both families have been seen bonding on more than one occasion.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Travis' dad</a>, Taylor is "a very, very sweet, very charming, down-to-earth young woman." Ever since he met her, he Ed Kelce impressed with her. He recalled a time when they were watching one of Travis' matches, and afterwards she took the time to clean up the trash people had left behind. <strong>"I don't think she got the diva memo," he said. "She didn't get the spoiled musician. She doesn't know how to pull that off. And that really to me said a whole lot."</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-19t065511-258.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>An Inside Look At Taylor Swift's Relationship With Her Parents</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite the many health struggles her parents have faced, Andrea and Scott Swift always prioritized Taylor's dreams and passion for music.</span><p><strong>As for Taylor's family, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to sources</a>, they are "so relieved by her relationship with Travis — not only because she is madly in love but also because he makes her security personnel job much easier."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift has sadly faced a lot of safety issues due to her level of popularity, but <a href=#>her family is so grateful she has Travis by her side</a>.
