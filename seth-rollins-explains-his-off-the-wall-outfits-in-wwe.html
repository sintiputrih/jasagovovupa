Rollins performs any role he is given to perfection, and that is especially true for his current gimmick.</p><p>Ever since he turned heel a couple of years ago, The Visionary has been expressing himself via his overly flashy and sometimes outrageous outfits. Fans truly feel it suits his gimmick as well.</p><p>While speaking with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariel Helwani for BT Sport</a>, Seth Rollins revealed how he was at first hesitant to go all in on the outfit idea and then explained his outfits in general.</p><p>“In the beginning, I was kind of hesitant to just 100% go with it. But as I was just getting more comfortable in the character — because when I first started, I didn’t really know, I didn’t have a full grip on what the character was going to look like or where I was going to pull motivation from; I had a couple of ideas, but honestly, it was not where it’s at now is not where I saw it at the beginning.</p><p>The clothes were just like — I was trying to do something completely different, you know? Something that was off the wall, but a bit of a throwback to your Ric Flairs, or your Rick Rudes, or another one Gorgeous George. Just these flamboyant characters, and how could I modernize that, right?”</p><p>The Visionary and The Original Bro are set to square off against each other in a Fight Pit match at WWE Extreme Rules, with Daniel Cormier as the special guest referee. We’ll have to see who will be the victor in the match.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this feud?
