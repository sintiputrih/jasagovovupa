The fame she achieved at 21 remains intact even at 27 years of age which is evident by her 22.5 million followers on Instagram and now growing following on OnlyFans. These are just some of the many social media platforms through which she still stays connected to her fans.</p><p>Promoting her OnlyFans account, Mia teasingly posted a topless picture as the comments rolled in praising the Lebanese beauty. The 27-year-old who was once Pornhub’s most-watched star shared the sizzling snap from her recent visit to a beach in Casa Xixim, Mexico as reported by The Sun.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside the image, the porn star turned sports presenter wrote: "Alexa, play Dakiti.&nbsp;"Physically I'm home, but mentally I'm in paradise taking pics for Only Fans."</p><p>"This is all very new to me, I've never been on a platform as fan-facing, so any suggestions for improving my presence here is greatly appreciated! I love you!"</p><p>She posted another picture of herself running in a burnt yellow bikini and wrote a caption thanking her fans, “Running to 2021 and the vaccine. But first I just want to thank everyone who has supported me on Only Fans since September. You guys have helped me donate over $160k to charities and organizations that mean the most to me, I’m so grateful for the platform and all the incredible, strong, determined women I’ve met through the internet because of it. You guys have taught me so much and helped me grow as a person in more ways than I can ever thank you for.”</p><p>Mia, who married Swedish chef Robert Sandberg in June 2020, quit the porn industry six years ago after making 11 films. This is her second marriage. Her first marriage was to her high school boyfriend in 2016. She had first begun sharing NSFW images on Reddit, landing her a stint in the porn world in 2014. &nbsp;In 2017, the Lebanon born beauty landed a new role as a host of a sports talk show.</p><p>The social media influencer hails from Beirut but relocated to the US with her family in 2001 amid the conflict in Southern Lebanon. Her family settled in Montgomery County, Maryland and she eventually moved away from home to attend the University of Texas where she graduated with a degree in history.</p><p>Mia became an overnight sensation after filming a threesome while wearing a hijab despite being raised Catholic. She was widely criticized for partaking in such a video and received death threats from all over the Middle East, including the Islamic state. A <a href=# rel=nofollow>petition</a> titled 'Justice for Mia Khalifa' recently was circulating on the Internet demanding that her videos be taken down after she recently admitted they will "haunt her until she dies."</p><p>She quit the industry shortly after working for just three months and relocated to Miami where she worked as a paralegal and bookkeeper. She also runs a YouTube channel and live streams on Twitch, while also performing as a webcam model through exclusive membership-based apps. Mia also shares insight about sports and players on her social media accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>What is Mia Khalifa's net worth?</h2><p>According to The Sun, it is estimated that Mia is worth approximately $4 million.</p><p><strong>How much money did Mia Khalifa make doing adult movies?</strong></p><p>In an interview in August 2019, Mia disclosed that while working in the porn industry for those three months, she only made a shocking $12,000, earning around $1,000 a scene.</p><p>After her short stint in the entertainment industry, &nbsp;she has been selling photos, merchandise, and other exclusive content on Patreon. She has hosted "Out of Bounds," a daily sports show on Complex News with Gilbert Arenas from October 2017 to February 2018. &nbsp;She also co-hosted "SportsBall" with Tyler Coe starting in July 2018. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Celebrity Net Worth</a> estimates that based on the size of her following, she probably earns $500,000 – $1 million per year doing sponsored social media posts.</p><p>After a month on OnlyFans, Mia was able to make a $100,000 donation to the Lebanese Red Cross, vital to fund recovery efforts following the explosion in Beirut in August 2020.
