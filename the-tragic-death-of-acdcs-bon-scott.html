After his death, though, the band were at a loss, as <a href=#>Angus Young describes</a>: "For us, it was like losing a member of your family. It's very, very difficult to go through something like that. Not only is it your friend, it's also somebody you've been working with all that time."&nbsp;</p><p>However, Scott's parents asked them to continue, so they sought out <a href=#>Brian Johnson</a>, a singer Bon Scott had compared to his idol Little Richard. They proceeded to record Back in Black as a tribute to Scott, per <a href=#>Ultimate Classic Rock</a>: "We wouldn't have even done him justice in words. Even the bell in the beginning of 'Hell's Bells' was our little tribute." The album proceeded to skyrocket to one of the best selling albums of all time. But due to the fact that Scott was supposed to sing in the studio the next day, rumors have always circulated around the fan base that either he had written the songs, which are all credited to Brian Johnson and the brothers Young, or that there is some vault of Scott vocal recordings for the album.</p><p>No concrete evidence for either of these theories exists. Yet even though he died before AC/DC truly exploded into the rock band many recognize today, Bon Scott's status as an Australian icon remains secure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BkWxrcGtfqbWmedOrmKChk2Kxpq3ToWSonl2WsKWv0maZqKZdqLCwwNNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
