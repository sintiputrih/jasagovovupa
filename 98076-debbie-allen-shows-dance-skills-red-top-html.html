Since then, she has racked up 53 acting credits to her name.</p><p class=Fg>She is also a successful director, with 47 credits to her name, and producer, with 19 credits. Allen also has a deep love of dance, and even started the Debbie Allen Dance Academy, a non-profit organization that teaches a comprehensive dance curriculum to students.</p><p class=Fg>Allen herself is quite a talented dancer, a skill she decided to demonstrate on the 4th of July with an Instagram post in celebration of the American holiday.</p><p class=Fg>In the clip, Allen wore a tea-length flowing white skirt, a red shirt with a cape-like sleeve, and a pair of white sneakers.</p><p class=Fg>Allen danced around the small floor, showing off her skills to an enamored audience, as the band played the tune behind her.</p><p class=Fg>While the rest of the United States celebrated the day at home likely surrounded by friends and family, Allen was in Havana, Cuba at the time.</p><p class=Fg>The post already has close on 200,000 views, and over 50,000 likes.</p><p class=Fg>After her starring role in <i class=Eg>West Side Story</i>, Allen went on to appear in the movie <i class=Eg>Fame</i> as a dance instructor that same year. The movie was later adapted into a series spin-off, and Allen ended up winning 3 Emmy's for her choreography.</p><p class=Fg>While she opened her dance studio in 2001, she has continued to act, and is currently a series regular in the hit medical drama Grey's Anatomy, playing Dr Catherine Avery/Fox.</p><p class=Fg>Allen earned an honorary doctorate from the North Carolina School of the Arts, a school she had been rejected from as a teenager based on the color of her skin. It was not the only school she had been rejected from on the basis of race.</p><p class=Fg>When she was 12, Allen auditioned for the Houston Ballet School in Texas. Despite an excellent audition, the school denied her entry for being black. Later, a Russian instructor who had seen her dance enrolled her in the school in secret.</p><p class=Fg>By the time th administration realized what had been done, they were so impressed with her dancing that they allowed her to stay.</p><p class=Fg>Her rejection from the North Carolina School of the Arts was even more shocking, as during her audition she had actually been asked to demonstrate tenchniques to others auditioning.</p><p class=Fg>She was later told her "body was unsuited for ballet," something that, according to <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/people/debbie-allen-538186><i class=Eg>Biography.com</i></a>, was something often said to dancers of color to discourage them.</p><p class=Fg>During her career, Allen has also been given a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Women in Radio and Television.</p><p class=Fg>Allen is currently married to former NBA star Norm Nixon, with whom she has two children. She was previously married to Winnfred Wilford.</p><p class=Fg>Allen also credits a great deal of her success to her mother's example. When Allen was 10, her mother decided on a whim to move the family down to Mexico.</p><p class=Fg>"She didn't know anybody in Mexico," Allen recalled. "She didn't speak Spanish. She was looking for another level of experience...I respect that so much."</p><p class=Fg>Vivian Ayers Allen is now 95 years old, and her daughter took to her Instagram account with a special happy birthday message on the day.</p><p class=Fg>Allen's mother grinned a huge smile in the photo, wearing a loose-fitting white dress with lace inserts on the sleeves, and a colorful lei around her neck. She appeared to be enjoying a Hawaiian themed birthday party.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jnJvaW9mYrGmrsGinGaZnKGyr3nSoaawq12Zrq%2BvxGaqpKGcocBuvsSdZK2noGO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
