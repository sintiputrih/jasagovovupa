After enduring years of disastrous attempts at bringing anime to life (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">just take a look at Death Note</a>), anime and manga fans were ready to throw in the towel on this budding genre in television. Although they reluctantly accepted the news, many fans still remain <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unconvinced about the future of the Straw Hats</a> in human form.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=681 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>For that reason, Netflix finds itself facing a daunting challenge in creating a worthy adaptation of One Piece. With over 2 million volumes sold per edition in Japan alone, this colossal literary force has amassed a legion of fiercely loyal fans, who demand nothing short of perfection. Even the manga’s author, Eiichiro Oda, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had to plead for a chance</a> after fans witnessed countless disappointments in past adaptations of his work. As the series’ release date looms closer (or at least, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we hope it does</a>), it’s only fair that we grant this cast of fresh faces the opportunity to shine as the Straw Hats. Personally, I believe they’ll exceed our expectations.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=109 data-injectable=false>And now, let’s meet the actors who will portray the Straw Hats in the One Piece live-action adaptation.</p><h2 id=h-monkey-d-luffy-inaki-godoy data-injectable=false>Monkey D. Luffy – Iñaki Godoy</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Iñaki Godoy (@inakigo)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=646 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>Taking on the monumental task of portraying the iconic character and the charismatic captain of the Straw Hat crew is none other than Iñaki Godoy. Hailing from Mexico, this young actor appears to be the ideal choice to bring Luffy to life. While we haven’t witnessed his performance just yet, one look at Godoy’s appearance alone reveals a 19-year-old from Mexico City who effortlessly embodies the spirited and hopeful nature that defines Luffy. As the most challenging role in the series, Godoy’s extensive repertoire of credits will undoubtedly work in his favor as he steps into the shoes of the future King of the Pirates.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Roronoa Zoro – Mackenyu Arata</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mackenyu (@mackenyu)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=657 data-current-count=957 data-injectable=true>Stepping into the role of the physically gifted swordsman of the Straw Hat crew, Zoro, is none other than Mackenyu Arata. Anime fans may already be familiar with this name and for good reason. Despite his young age of 26, Mackenyu boasts an extensive acting repertoire, predominantly from his home country of Japan. Notably, he has showcased his talents in various live-action adaptations of popular anime, such as Jojo’s Bizarre Adventures and Tokyo Ghoul S. With his notable experience in live-action projects, Mackenyu is undoubtedly the ideal choice for Zoro, though he might have to hit the gym to match the character’s impressive physique.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Nami – Emily Rudd</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Cherin Choi (@mizzchoi)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=706 data-current-count=1006 data-injectable=true>Stepping into the role of the cunning “cat burglar” Nami is the talented Emily Rudd. Similar to Godoy, Rudd has already made a name for herself in the acting world with notable titles like the Amazon anthology series The Romanoffs and the American drama Hunters. Tasked with portraying the enigmatic and money-driven Nami, Rudd faces the challenge of capturing the character’s emotional journey as she embarks on her compelling adventure alongside the Straw Hat crew. It’s undoubtedly an emotionally demanding role, but one can only hope that Rudd will enjoy embodying Nami as much as we enjoy reading about her. And who knows, maybe she’ll even dye her hair red for the role!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Usopp – Jacob Romero Gibson</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.instagram.com/p/CR9OjoVFjuN/?hl=en</figure><p data-characters=612 data-current-count=912 data-injectable=true>Usopp, the one and only sniper of the Straw Hats, couldn’t have been cast more perfectly than with Jacob Romero Gibbs. Not only does Gibbs possess the ideal appearance to embody the bravest man of the sea (well, potentially), though he may be missing Usopp’s signature long nose. While Gibbs may have a slightly shorter acting resume compared to his fellow Straw Hats, his own accomplishments are far from lacking. Recognized for his role in Greenleaf and even making a cameo appearance on Grey’s Anatomy, this 26-year-old actor is poised to excel as the senior officer of the Straw Hats fleet.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Vinsmoke Sanji – Taz Skylar</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by • TAZ SKYLAR • (@taz_skylar)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=617 data-current-count=917 data-injectable=true>The charming womanizer and culinary expert of the Straw Hats will be brought to life by the Spanish actor, Taz Skylar. Having delved into the world of acting since 2015, Skylar has already amassed an array of television roles. With his perfect blond hair to embody the left hand of the Straw Hats, Skylar’s already captivating smile will undoubtedly capture the essence of Sanji’s flirtatious nature, even if he’s not always lucky. In the meantime, Skylar will need to figure out how to grow Sanji’s iconic goatee and, of course, be prepared to always have those prop cigarettes in his mouth.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=false>Considering the live-action will only capture the East Blue saga, the other Straw Hats have not yet been cast (as far as we know). Of course, in the end, the continuation of the series lies in the hands of Netflix, and we all know how that usually goes. It is still in the hands of fans to see whether or not this adaptation will be fruitful, and for the time being, we have to wait a while more until we set sail on this adventure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxloKGuurXNoGSlrZabxm61zWaroZ1dpLumec%2BinJydXaG2t7GMmpqtoZ%2Bjeqmx0Z5kmqqVYq6tuIytn55lkZjBsL7SZqelmameu6h506GcZqukp664eceaq6xn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
