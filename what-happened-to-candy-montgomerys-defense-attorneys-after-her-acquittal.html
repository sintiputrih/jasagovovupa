Per <a href=# rel=noopener>Texas Monthly</a>, Crowder was a partner at a small firm and primarily focused on personal injury cases.

As reported by <a href=# rel=noopener>UPI</a>, Crowder used his final argument to tell the jury that the prosecution had “not one word of evidence that has refuted the testimony of self-defense.”&nbsp;Montgomery was found not guilty by reason of self-defense.
