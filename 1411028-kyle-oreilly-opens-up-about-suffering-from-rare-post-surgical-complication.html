The multi-time tag team champion underwent neck fusion surgery last September and has been going through a grueling recovery process every since.</p><p>In a new <a href=#>Instagram</a> post, O’Reilly revealed that he has been battling a rare post-surgical complication that caused a loss of mobility in his right arm. His doctors described it as “C5 palsy.”</p><p>O’Reilly wrote, “Needless to say it was disheartening to relearn activities like brushing my teeth and wiping my ass with my left hand. My career wasn’t in question any longer, it was my quality of life. But focusing on what I could control every day kept me sane, such as being the best father I could possibly be. Every other moment has been spent rehabbing, dry needling and training.”</p><p>Luckily, the discovery of Neubie, an electric stimulation machine, has helped him stimulate the nerves in order to gain a full range of motion in his shoulder.</p><p>He added, “A few months ago I discovered the Neubie device @neufitrfp an electric stim machine that runs on direct current akin to the human nervous system. The machine has many terrific uses but specializes in helping those with post-surgical neurological injuries. Within a month of using the Neubie I once again had full range of motion in my shoulder. My nerves are all online again and firing with enough power to get the dinosaurs back in their pens.”</p><p>O’Reilly also thanked his trainer and diet coach for helping him out during his recovery journey. At this point, he feels like a return to the ring is within sight rather than a mirage.</p><p>You can read his post in its entirety embedded below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>WrestleZone will continue to provide updates on O’Reilly’s recovery as more information becomes available.</p><p><a href=#>Adam Cole On Kyle O’Reilly: There’s Still No Timetable On His Return, But He’s Getting Better Every Week</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqaGlqaGK4urjEZqarnZmhubp5zqmcp6tdqr1urcGorK1lo6qzp7HRoqWgZZanvK550ZqpnmWgpMC1edKuqaChk5a5bq%2FOpqeloZOWwaq7zQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
