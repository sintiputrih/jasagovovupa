The actress was a guest on the popular interview show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hot Ones</a> for First We Feast which sees celebrities attempt to answer questions while eating wings that get increasingly hotter.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Pugh has had a tremendous past few years and was invited <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on the show</a> to promote her most recent film A Good Person which was directed by her now ex-boyfriend Zach Braff. The show’s host, Sean Evans, had his usual list of insightful and interesting questions to ask Pugh about her career and hobbies whilst the actress took on the challenge.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>Pugh has her own little cooking space online called Cooking with Flo, with the actress delighting us all with her general enthusiasm for food while looking fabulous and being hilarious. Her enthusiasm was let loose during the interview as she gushed over which sauce she would love on a jacket potato, “what about that on potatoes, a jacket potato, with some cheddar… and sour cream!” Evans took notes.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>She also had her own method of avoiding getting the hot sauce in her eyes, by holding one hand up in the air in order to keep it clean; having watched the show on numerous occasions she did not want to repeat the errors of past guests. As with almost all guests she hilariously struggled with some of the hotter sauces, particularly Da Bomb, tearing up and finding herself unable to think clearly while also sweating from her eyebrows.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>At the end of the interview, the British actress was asked to give a step-by-step guide on making the perfect cup of tea while she struggled to handle the heat of the last wing. Of course, she showed off the classic dunking of the biscuit, which as a British person myself, I applaud her for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBorfEZqqopZViwaq5xGarqGWVo7ewxYyfo6iqlaOwpnnPrp6hZaOssqLAyKeeZp6ipLputMSrZJ6xlZe%2FsMPSZq6hoZyaeqat06KloGWYpMFuw8innqxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
