They desperately need some cash, and Milena Axelrod is the only family member capable of bailing them out. However, upon docking on her ship, her money doesn’t come from the most legitimate ways: she’s a smuggler who’s crossed both the Trade Authority and the Akila City Mayor. Though she’d love to help her family out, it’s unlikely these two will just let her just waltz through the Akila City front gate. Who should you make a deal with, The Mayor or the Trade Authority?</p><h2>Starfield: Rough Landings All Outcomes & Best Choice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Starfield-Rough-Landings-2.jpg><h3>Starfield: Get Milena access from the Trade Authority in Rough Landings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Starfield-Rough-Landings-3.jpg><p data-injection=true>Tom is an agent from the Trade Authority. He’s quick to say yes to allowing Milena back into the city since, as he points out, “the Trade Authority is always happy to facilitate business.” They will gladly produce a fake ID for Milena to get into Akila City in exchange for some credits.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield False Positives: How to Search The Security Logs</a></p><p data-injection=true>There’s no alternative here; no way to persuade or find any way around paying up. For 1000 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">credits</a>, Tom will get a fake ID for Milena, and she can join her family and help them out.</p><h3>Starfield: Get Milena Access from Mayor Cartwright in Rough Landings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Starfield-Rough-Landings-4.jpg><p data-injection=true>Mayor Cartwright has got a severe bone to pick with Milena. She even punched him in the face. Let’s just say he’s not so keen on any type of deal to bring her back. However, he offers a couple more choices that may not require straight-up payment.</p><p>There is, of course, the option to pay 5000 credits to clear her bounty. This is more than what the Trade Authority asks, but it is the legal way to give Milena access to Akila City.</p><p data-injection=true>Still, there’s a second option to persuade him to let go of his grudge against her. It’s an 8-slot persuasion check in 3 turns. Needless to say, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s not an easy feat</a>, so it’s recommended to quicksave before making any attempts.</p><p>If joining the Freestar Rangers doesn’t sound like too much of a hassle, that gets you a free pass with the Mayor. You can say you’ll vouch for her, and though the Mayor won’t be exceedingly happy about any of this, he’ll agree to let her in.</p><p>Regardless of the choice, speak with Marko in Akila City once more to finish Rough Landings.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dd39bd735ebf6fbf05d2fe8f91a978f7?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Cande Maldonado</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Though Cande started her journey in the video game industry as a localization specialist six years ago, she soon realized that her true calling was to annoy NPCS, smash virtual pottery, and complete every side quest available in RPGs.

Her passion for games dates to 2006, when she mounted a Chocobo for the first time. Under Nintendo and Square Enix's chokehold, she will willingly pour hours upon hours into reaching 100% completion in the longest roleplaying games ever made.
