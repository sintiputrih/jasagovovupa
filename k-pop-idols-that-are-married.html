There are in fact <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">K-pop</a></strong> idols that have tied the knot, despite the growing pressure from the industry to maintain singleness, or at least the aura of it. The large and ever-growing Hallyu wave is not without its faults, and has come under backlash for its continuous need to portray idols as single and available.
