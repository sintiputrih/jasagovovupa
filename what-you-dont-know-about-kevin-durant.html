His love of investing and becoming involved with other businesses grew even more after moving to the Bay Area as a member of the Golden State Warriors. After games, he would hang out with celebrities in the local tech community.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>For example, Durant once "celebrated his birthday at a lavish barbecue at the house of Ben Horowitz, the influential venture capitalist," per <a href=#>The New York Times</a>. Soon after, Durant was spotted "at the home of Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president for internet software and services, along with Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, and Pharrell Williams." According to Durant, he liked hanging out with the techies because he found similarities with his own story. "They built something from the ground up, so they can relate to us," Durant said. He explained, "I think that's why a lot of athletes and entertainers work well with some of those guys, because for one, they all had humble beginnings." As a result, the NBA star founded his eponymous investment vehicle, the Durant Company.</p><p dir=ltr>Some of the higher profile companies that Durant invested in were Postmates and the financial app Acorns, <a href=#>The Undefeated</a> reported. His company later rebranded to be called <a href=#>Thirty Five Ventures</a>. With this venture, Durant invested in more than 75 companies as of 2021 with a wide-ranging portfolio, like businesses for cryptocurrency and media, according to his NBA profile.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGllbYZ0e9ahmK1lqaTCbrDOp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWbmsOquoydrKuZnql8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
