Two days after <a href=#><strong>Demi Lovato</strong></a> <a href=#>showed off her killer beach body</a> on Instagram in a tiny leopard-print bikini, the “Confident” singer was back at it, giving fans even more of an eyeful in the same minuscule suit.</p><p>“I adora Bora Bora,” the Grammy nominee, 26, captioned <a href=#>a series of shots</a> on Monday, May 13.</p><p>In the pics, a sunkissed Lovato can be seen tugging at the sides of her high-cut bottoms in a pair of reflective sunglasses and raising her tattooed arms above her head with a smile.</p><p>The Disney alum <a href=#>clapped back at critics of her body</a> in March after an article described her figure as “fuller.” “I AM MORE THAN MY WEIGHT,” she wrote on Instagram Stories at the time.</p><p>While Lovato claimed that she was not triggered by the article, she was upset. “I’m angry that people think it’s OK to write headlines about people’s body shapes,” she wrote. Especially a woman who has been so open about being in recovery [for] an eating disorder. I’m not upset for myself but for anyone easily influenced by the diet culture.”</p><p>The former Sonny With a Chance star is seemingly on a personal and professional high as of late: She celebrated <a href=#>six months of sobriety</a> with a new tattoo in February and<a href=#> announced that she signed</a> with <a href=#><strong>Scooter Braun</strong></a>, manager to A-listers such as <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>, on Sunday, May 12.</p><p>“Demi is <a href=#>determined to stay motivated</a> and sober,” a source told Us Weekly exclusively in April. “She knows at the end of the day everything is reliant on her own decision-making process.”</p><p>The insider revealed that in addition to keeping her family and friends “close,” the songstress is staying “committed to her schedule, working out and staying away from negative influences to stay healthy.”</p><p>Lovato was <a href=#>hospitalized</a> in July 2018 after she suffered an overdose in her L.A. home and had to be revived by paramedics.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She was released from the <a href=#>hospital into treatment</a> in August 2018 where she stayed for 90 days. She later <a href=#>checked back into the facility</a> for a brief stay.</p><p>“It was Demi’s decision and she checked out after about two weeks,” an insider shared at the time. “She is in a better headspace and recognizes the seriousness of her addiction.”</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, contact the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline</a> at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNksaa5yGajqK6Rqbxur86nq6KmpZrAbsDOZqeoq6Rivaqv0magp2WcmryxrdGdZJuhm567qnnIp2Sbp6KWeqO70Zpm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
