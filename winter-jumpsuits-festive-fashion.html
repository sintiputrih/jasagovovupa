It’s “the most wonderful time of the year,” and we’d like to mark the occasion by looking fabulous. I look forward to dressing up for holiday parties all year long, and my go-to is almost always a jumpsuit. I have them in silk green, glitzy gold and a tailored black one-piece which looks like a sleek suit. What I love about jumpsuits is how polished they make you look — while being the easiest thing to throw on without an hour-long debate in your closet about mixing and matching.</p><p>No matter your wintery occasion, I’ve rounded up a selection of casual and dressy looks that will carry you through the season and beyond so you can look picture-perfect for the ‘Gram.</p><p><strong>1.
