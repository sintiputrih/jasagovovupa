In this cheeky new iteration, romance will meet reality as fan-favorite islanders are faced with both team and couples’ challenges, all while navigating dating, eliminations, recoupling, dramatic arrivals, and new competition twists and turns like never before.”</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>As mentioned, despite powerhouses like&nbsp;Aurelia Lamprecht,&nbsp;Johnny Middlebrooks,&nbsp;Deb Chubb, and Callum Hole giving them a run for their money during the final duel, Justine and Jack were crowned the champions of Love Island Games, ultimately splitting a $100k cash prize in the end.</p><p data-characters=637 data-current-count=920 data-injectable=true>For those who need a bit of a refresher as to what the duo’s journey looked like on the hit competition show, Justine and Jack coupled up with one another on the first day in the villa (despite having different partners for the first challenge of the season, where Justine was partnered with&nbsp;Curtis Pritchard&nbsp;and Jack was partnered with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cely Vazquez</a>) and remained faithful to one another since. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The duo began to develop feelings for one another</a> as their journey on the hit competition show progressed, making their overall partnership and teamwork significantly better than their opponents, ultimately leading to their victory.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>With a strong social, strategic, and physical game, Justine and Jack were unstoppable throughout the inaugural season of Love Island Games. But is trying their luck on another beloved competition series in their future?</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>In an <a href=#>exclusive interview with The Messenger</a>, Justine and Jack talked about whether or not they will be gracing our television screens yet again. Keep scrolling to find out for yourself…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jack-Fowler-2.png><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>In said interview, reporter Charlotte Walsh briefly discussed Justine’s experience on both The Challenge: USA and The Challenge: World Championship, prior to asking the duo a question that everyone has been wondering <strong>—</strong> “Would you guys ever consider going on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Challenge</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Amazing Race</a>? What’s next for you both?”</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>“I keep telling him about&nbsp;The Challenge&nbsp;and have tried to convince him to do it, because I feel like as a competitor, I’ve seen him fired up. I feel like he would kill it,” Justine gushed, advocating for her partner to try his luck on The Challenge, just like she has in the past.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>For those who are unfamiliar with what The Challenge entails, competitors from “around the globe” go up against each other in the show “while forming friendships, rivalries, and romances”, badass reality competitors from around the globe” and “face off in cutthroat challenges and brutal eliminations, with the chance to earn their share of a million-dollar prize.”</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Former islanders like Johnny Middlebrooks, Curtis Pritchard, Cely Vazquez, Kyra Green, and more have competed in The Challenge in the past, as well as Justine, who placed third on The Challenge: USA and participated in The Challenge: World Championship the following summer. Given Jack’s competitive nature that fans of the Love Island franchise got to see on Love Island Games, we would love to watch him try to take home yet another win on a future season of The Challenge.</p><p data-characters=651 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>With The Challenge aside, The Amazing Race was also proposed, a show in which Justine and Jack could participate as a pair as the game show is about teams of two racing “around the world in competition with other teams.” Every team needs to strive hard to not be the last ones arriving at the end of each leg of the race in order to sidestep the risk of elimination. “Teams are progressively eliminated until three teams are left, and at that point, the team who arrives first in the final leg is awarded a large cash grand prize” <strong>—</strong> given Justin and Jack’s chemistry, we know the two lovebirds would dominate yet again!</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>Justine dished, “We do work so well together, so I feel like we would kill something like&nbsp;The Amazing Race&nbsp;or&nbsp;The Challenge&nbsp;or something, but he doesn’t really know what they are,” which is likely due to the fact that her partner is from the United Kingdom.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Admitting that he has no knowledge about The Amazing Race and that he has only heard of The Challenge through Justine, Jack exclaimed that he is “willing to learn.” Only time will tell what the future has in store for him.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>To watch Justine Ndiba and Jack Fowler’s journey on Love Island Games from start to finish,&nbsp;fans of the&nbsp;Love Island&nbsp;franchise can&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">watch the entirety of the beloved competition series</a> on Peacock now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tculZKOZk6B6p7vWpZyrZZOkurGx055kqKZdqbWmecKhmKWklaO0pnnOq2StoJVirq6t2aKloGWilrCmedOhnGaepanCs7GMqJ1mrJiaeq271Z5koquclrulecaapJ6rXay2r7rEq2SesKChrqq6xJ1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
