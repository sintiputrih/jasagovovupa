He did attempt to mount something of a comeback in Netflix series The Pentaverate where he played eight roles, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but the fact it was widely-panned and hardly made a dent on the streamer’s charts </a>hints that a renewal is unlikely.</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>Many reasons have been put forth as to why Myers decided to virtually drop off the face of the earth, and one of the most compelling to emerge recently is down to the fact he’s reportedly an asshole. That ball got rolling on Twitter, where a security guard who worked on The Love Guru claimed that he was fired for daring to make direct eye contact with the leading man, which then led to countless others touting their own tales of what working with the Austin Powers favorite was really like.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>People saying that “he shouldn’t be praised for helping” have no idea what it’s like working in film. Mike Myers had me fired off the set of “The Love Guru” because I made eye contact with him, and I was there as his body guard… 😂 Give Keanu his roses <a href=#>https://t.co/xfmOHvxObK</a></p>— Jay Brody (@theJaybrody) <a href=#>March 26, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>There’s also the infamous story of how Myers allegedly had someone in his employ during production on The Cat in the Hat who was there <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to specifically feed him chocolate whenever it was deemed a necessary requirement</a>, but Myers’ representatives have now moved to try and pour water on the claims.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>In a statement to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, a member of his team claimed that he didn’t even have a bodyguard on The Love Guru, and that “Mike knows nothing about this, not aware of anyone being hired or fired.” Obviously, he wouldn’t admit to it, but it gathered enough traction to dent his reputation on social media at the very least.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S6qrfEZqSynaKoeqWxzaKcrGWWnr%2BqusZmmGarlZjCs7XTsmSgrZGnsW6yzqtkraCVYsKvss6rnqKukZe5pnnSoqVmp5ZiuqK3yKeeZpyZp7KkwIyesJ5lk6S7ta3CrWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
