The company planned to unveil select pieces Thursday night at a party in the Calvin Klein Townhouse at the Soho Mews. The town house is located in the new luxury residences at 311 West Broadway designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects.</p><p>The Calvin Klein furniture collection will be sold exclusively at Macy’s as of January, and consists of three groups — City, Weekend and Destination — with each group having a specific wood finish of walnut, whitewash and teak, respectively.</p><p>The Curator collection by Calvin Klein Home is a more detailed and labor-intensive line that will be offered at select furniture stores. As of Oct. 20, that line will be shown by invitation only during the High Point, N.C., market in the Commerce & Design building.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title a-font-primary-regular-s lrv-u-margin-t-00 lrv-u-margin-b-075 lrv-u-color-black">Related Articles</h3><p>Tom Murry, president and chief executive officer of Calvin Klein Inc., said, “Strategically, the addition of furniture is very significant for us as it essentially completes the Calvin Klein Home lifestyle product offering.”</p><p>Set up in 1995, Calvin Klein Home, a $100 million entity at retail, already offers such licensed products as bed and bath products, tabletops, gifts, glassware, table linens and rugs. The new collections include sofas, chairs, beds, tables, mirrors and bookcases. Both lines borrow inspiration from Calvin Klein apparel and accessories, in terms of the textures, materials and hardware.</p><p>Retail prices for Calvin Klein furniture will range from $850 for a glass end table to $2,600 for a canopy bed. The Curator collection will start at $1,100 for a cocktail table to $5,000 for a walnut sleigh bed with hand-applied gold leaf. Licensing partners Alexandre International and Shayne Industries will oversee production, sales and distribution.</p><p>Calvin Klein is considering selling select pieces in its stores, said Calvin Klein Home’s creative director Amy Mellen, who led the in-house team that conceptualized and executed the project, which has been two years in the making. An advertising campaign is planned for publications including Elle Decor, Metropolitan Home, O at Home and Vanity Fair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp5l7pLvMaJ2emaSqv6Z7wpqjr6GeYritscinZKWZpaOwqbHSZp2uqp6ewba%2BxGZocWpian9yeZBub3JrYWx8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
