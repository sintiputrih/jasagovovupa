Husband And Kids</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>The oldest of Alan Jackson’s three daughters, Mattie, came into the world only a few months after the publication of Alan’s very popular smash first album Here in the Real World.</strong></p><p>Mattie, who was born on June 19, 1990, has just turned 33 this year. Before enrolling at the University of Tennessee to pursue creative writing, she allegedly attended Franklin Road Academy.</p><p>She spent time studying the business at the Joseph Phelps Vineyard in Napa Valley and Greece before getting her accreditation as a sommelier. In a Food & Wine interview, Mattie said that being a native of Nashville made her special since no one else was.</p><h2>What happened to Mattie Jackson Selecman, the daughter of Alan Jackson?</h2><p>Ben Selecman, Mattie Jackson Selecman’s husband, passed away on a wonderfully beginning day.</p><p>The Labor Day festivities got underway aboard her well-known father Alan Jackson’s yacht as friends and family arrived to take advantage of the Florida sunshine. Mattie and Ben Selecman were likewise basking in the bliss of their first year of marriage.</p><p>The 31-year-old Selecman speaks to PEOPLE about her late husband Ben, whom she met when they were both students at the University of Tennessee. We had just entered our first year of marriage. Ben had one of the most pronounced personalities of anybody I’ve ever met. He was energetic and made friends with everyone.</p><p>Mattie couldn’t take her eyes off Ben while he was commemorating that momentous day in late summer of 2018 until the unthinkable happened.</p><p>Mattie remembers that Ben “just slipped” and fell. “Because the pier was wet, he slid back and hit his head. The way they recovered was nearly comparable to seeing someone play high school football, despite the fact that it was a prolonged fall. While remaining aware and maybe suffering from a slight head injury, they start to stand back up.</p><p>But it didn’t take long to realize that this may be more than just a concussion.</p><p>However, things rapidly deteriorated after that. To halt what was occurring, surgeries and an 11-day medically induced coma were carried out.</p><p>But not all was lost. With the assistance of medical specialists and family members, the decision was reached to start rousing Ben up.</p><p>However, after a little while, it wasn’t. Ben suffered many strokes and severe brain damage as a result of a blood clot that had broken up inside his skull.</p><p>Ben Selecman died on September 12, 2018. At the age of 28, Mattie Jackson Selecman also lost her husband.</p><h2>What’s become of Mattie Jackson Selecman? Explored: Husband and children</h2><p>The daughter of country music legend Alan Jackson, Mattie Jackson Selecman, has found love again after losing her first spouse in a terrible tragedy four years before.</p><p>Mattie, 33, who she initially connected with in late 2021 via a close friend, said on Sunday that she was engaged to Connor Smith.</p><p>She said in the Instagram caption of a picture of her engagement ring, “Feeling extremely thankful, delighted, and thrilled for this kind-of-surprise but so-fervently-prayed-for ENGAGEMENT.” “Connor Smith, I appreciate your positive outlook on life, kind nature, and amazing zeal for living. I can’t wait to be married to you and have a family with you! In the nicest conceivable package, you are the finest present. Baby, I adore you.</p><p>Smith and Mattie, who Jackson shares with his wife Denise, were engaged as Smith was celebrating his 30th birthday in Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p>Ben Selecman, Mattie’s spouse, died in September 2018 from a brain injury he got when he slid on a boat dock, ending his life after being hospitalized for four years.</p><p>The crash severely injured the 28-year-old Assistant District Attorney for Tennessee’s Davidson County, who subsequently died tragically after numerous procedures and an 11-day medically induced coma.</p><p>Mattie announced her first connection with Smith in April, saying they had met at a happy hour six months earlier.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
