That being said, 2009’s <strong>Ink </strong>was made on a shoestring budget of just $250,000, yet ranks as one of the genre’s most acclaimed entries of the last decade and a half.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>On Rotten Tomatoes, the ambitious undertaking orchestrated by writer, director, producer, editor, and composer Jamin Winans holds a perfect 100 percent critical approval rating, while upwards of 5000 user ratings have deemed it worthy of an impressive 81 percent score.

It came along without much in the way of fanfare in spite of almost unanimous acclaim, before being largely lost to the sands of time. With any justice, it’ll eventually find the size of audience it deserves, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">because no self-respecting fan of the fantastical </a>should go about their business without having seen it at least once.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGaikax6pb7OqaeippdiwKS1jJ%2BgZp6Ro8Giv9hmpJqclWK8r3nAZqqhp5WowbO1zaBkm62UnLK1ecWuo6WxXZmytLHRr5ysZZmpwG68xKudnpukYr%2BwwNOepWasn6KutbvErGSsm5%2BnsnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
