Sex and the City completed its six-season run in 2004, during which the close-knit bunch bonded over their ups and downs with the Manhattan dating scene.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Chris Noth</strong></a> (John James “Mr. Big” Preston), <a href=#><strong>John Corbett</strong></a> (Aidan Shaw), <a href=#><strong>Evan Handler</strong></a> (Harry Goldenblatt), <strong>David Eigenberg</strong> (Steve Brady), <a href=#><strong>Jason Lewis</strong></a> (Jerry “Smith” Jerrod), <strong>Willie Garson</strong> (Stanford Blatch) and <a href=#><strong>Mario Cantone</strong></a> (Anthony Marantino) also starred.</p><p>The sitcom’s success led to the release of two major motion pictures: Sex and the City in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010. While <a href=#>a third film</a> was once a possibility, the project was ultimately scrapped.</p><p>Cattrall, for one, told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> in July 2019 that she would “never” agree to do a third film and seemingly <a href=#>implied that her feud with Parker was part of that decision</a>. Just before that comment surfaced, it was revealed on <strong>James Andrew Miller</strong>’s <a href=#>“Origins” podcast</a> that Cattrall <a href=#>was also not happy with the script</a>.</p><p>“People close to Kim believe that the script didn’t have a lot to offer the character of Samantha,” Miller explained in November 2018. “They point to the fact that it calls for Mr. Big to die of a heart attack in the shower, relatively early on in the film, making the remainder of the movie more about how Carrie recovers from Big’s death than about the relationship between the four women.”</p><p>Though a third film is very unlikely, Parker said she still wouldn’t be opposed to reprising her iconic character. The Hocus Pocus star, however, would refer to it as a “revisit” and not a “reboot” and is also curious to know where the four leading ladies ended up.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I mean, the world has changed so much, technology and social media,” she told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in September 2019. “Those characters never talked about social media, which I think would be really interesting and just also sexual politics and the <a href=#>#MeToo movement and Time’s Up</a> has really steered conversations about sexual politics.”</p><p>In January 2021, Parker <a href=# rel>confirmed that she was reprising her role as Carrie </a>in a SATC reboot for HBO Max titled And Just Like That. Nixon and Davis — along with a number of other original cast members — are joining her in the revival.</p><p>Scroll down to see <a href=#>what the cast has been up to</a> in the years since the original series ended.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bosrl5wKebZqyYmnqktdOyZJyZo6l6uLTEq5xmmaKaerW0xLJkp6enZLC6utOhoJplnp7FsLqMpqCrmZ6Zrm60zpuZnqtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
