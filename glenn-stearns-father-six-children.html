While <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">he was</a> in eighth grade, his eldest child, daughter <strong>Charlene Stearns,</strong> was born. At that time, Charlene’s mother, <strong>Kathy</strong> was just 17 years old. So, the young parents’ mothers helped them raise Charlene.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Glenn-Stearns-has-six-kids-from-three-different-baby-mamas.jpg><p>As Glenn gave birth to Charlene when he was a teenager, he often admitted that she felt more like a younger sister to him than a daughter at that time. But, now, he claims her as his best friend. Currently, Glenn Stearns’ daughter, Charlene Stearns, manages his escrow company.</p><p>Furthermore, though Glenn Stearns welcomed a baby with Kathy, he did not marry her. Instead, some years after the birth of Charlene, he married <strong>Amber Urone</strong>. With Amber, he welcomed three boys, <strong>Skyler Stearns, Colby Stearns</strong>, and <strong>Trevor Stearns</strong>.</p><p>However, Glenn’s marriage with Amber did not last long. As a result, they divorced after the birth of their three sons but remained close friends.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Glenn_Stearns_Children_With_His_Wife_Mindy_Burbano></span>Glenn Stearns’ Children With His Wife Mindy Burbano<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Currently, Glenn Stearns is in a happy relationship with <strong>Mindy Burbano, </strong>a&nbsp;dental hygienist turned TV Presenter, actress, and philanthropist.

The <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">couple exchanged wedding</a> vows on a property they bought in Southern California for $12 million, surrounded by 450 guests and their close ones.</p><p>Making their marriage ceremony a true family affair, the beautiful pair also included Glenn Stearns’ children from his previous relationships. Charlene served as one of the bridesmaids, while Stearns’ son, Skyler, served as the best man. Similarly, Trevor was their ring bearer, while Colby had a job as a groomsman.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Stearns_Kids_Maintain_Their_Life_Low-key></span>Stearns’ Kids Maintain Their Life Low-key<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>All six of Glenn Stearns’ children from three different baby mamas seem to prefer their life away from the reach of excess media scrutiny. Though they are available on social media handles, they never share their personal information on them. Moreover, their parents also always make sure their everyday life remains a closed book, far from the sight of the public and the media people.</p><p>Furthermore, though Glenn Sterns and his children usually maintain a private life, we can confirm that Glenn is a grandfather to two grandkids from his eldest child, Charlene. However, sadly, the names of Glenn Sterns’ grandchildren and their father is not known to the public yet.</p><p>So, the successful American businessman Glenn Stearns is currently a father to six grown-up kids and a grandpa to two adorable grandchildren. We hope to have more insight into the life of Stearns kins and their whereabouts in the upcoming days.</p><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & TV Series</a>,</strong>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;<i><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebrityMirror</a>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq7JlkpavqrHSaJ6lnZ6jerTAxJqpp6tdm661tMSrZKyhqGKwqbXLnamepl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
