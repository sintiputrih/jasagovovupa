The artist continues to drop EPs and short projects to tide fans over until the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">release of&nbsp;Pink Heartz which will be his debut album</a>. This new project is slated to release later in 2022, and fans are certainly excited for it to finally come out.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The artist has created a ton of buzz especially ever since signing with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a>'s Cactus Jack imprint. His status in the game is rising and it just so happens that&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he was named to the 2022 XXL Freshman List.</a> This is always a huge honor for young artists, and today, his freestyle was released by XXL.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/30/42/124230_01e54616fd0fbf96c1ef34458bb137db.jpg><p><h6>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As you can see in the clip down below, SoFaygo decided to get melodic with his flow as he recited the lyrics line by line as if he could already envision the beat that should have been playing underneath. At times, these freestyles are awkward because there is no production, and the lines are already part of another song. Despite this, SoFaygo did a good job controlling his voice and making things smooth.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">There is no doubt that the artist has a ton of talent, and it is going to be interesting to see how he develops over the next few months. With&nbsp;Pink Heartz&nbsp;on the horizon, we are definitely in for a treat.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of SoFaygo's freestyle, in the comments section down below.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
