He started his career as a politician, standing as an independent candidate in the 2001 election, but lost to Habib Hassan of Pakistan Peoples Party. In 2003, his father was murdered by gangster Arshad Pupu. His cousin Rehman Dakait invited him to join his gang. Uzair initially refused but later acquiesced and joined as they shared a common enemy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=activities-and-arrests></span><span id=Activities_and_arrests>Activities and arrests</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2005, Uazir was arrested by a Sindh police SP Chaudhry Aslam but was later released on bail due to his links with politicians. After the encounter of Rehman Dakait, Uzair became the new gang leader and was involved in many criminal activities. He also became chief of Peoples Aman Committee. Uzair also had links with Pakistan Peoples Party and was protected by PPP until 2012. In June 2014, Sindh Government issued his red warrants and head money of Rs.2 million. He was wanted for more than 50 cases of extortions, target killings of policemen and gang members. Uzair left Pakistan after his red warrants were issued. On 29 December 2014, he was arrested by Interpol from Dubai International Airport. He was taken into custody by Interpol and was brought back to Pakistan. He was travelling from Muscat to Dubai. On January 30 2016, Sindh Rangers took Uzair into custody after getting his physical remand from Sindh High Court’s administrative judge for the Anti Terrorism Courts. He is currently in Mithadar hostel, Karachi under the custody of Sindh Rangers. In February 2016, Uzair’s wife Samina Baloch filed application in the Sindh High Court to seek orders for his medical examination and permission for his family members to meet him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fqseitdFmmZqkn5i1bq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6ywJyrZpuRp7KmvoyarpqqlKh6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqK6w2ajop6VYsC1u9GyZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
