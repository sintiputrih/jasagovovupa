According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Lee Min-ho’s net worth is as high as $10 million, an amount earned through his successful acting career. In addition to being a highly popular actor in South Korea, Min-ho has also worked as a model and musician which improved his net worth.</p><h3>Lee Min-ho Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Lee Min-ho wanted to become a professional footballer, but he suffered an injury while in elementary school, so his dreams were squashed. Instead, he started modelling and acting in the second year of high school. Lee had some minor roles from 2003 to 2007, when he landed his first leading role in a mini-series “Mackerel Run”, but it was cancelled after only eight episodes due to low ratings.</p><p>Also in 2007, Lee appeared in the series “I’m Sam”, and later in his first feature movie “Public Enemy 3” (2008) starring Kyung-gu Sol, Jae-yeong Jeong, and Jung-shik Bae, and in comedy “Our School’s E.T.” (2008). Lee gained a national-wide popularity with the role in series “Boys Over Flowers” in 2009, where he played Goo Joon Pyo, one of the four richest kids of the elite the elite Shin Hwa High Scool. This leading role significantly improved his net worth and also secured him roles in the future.</p><p>In 2010, Lee starred in “Personal Taste”, before landing a major part in series “City Hunter” (2011), playing Lee Yun-seong, a vengeful guy trained to kill everyone who stands in his way of personal vendetta. When the series finished, Lee had become a well-known actor and one of Korean cinematography’s biggest hopes. The next year, Lee filmed the series called “Faith”, a fantasy-drama that received good ratings and critiques. In 2013, Lee had a part in the series “Heirs”, a story of privileged, elite students who are trained to take over their families’ business; Lee played Kim Tan in 20 episodes.</p><p>After the success of “Heirs”, Lee switched to films, and most recently has appeared in the crime-drama “Gangnam Blues” (2015), and is currently shooting “Bounty Hunters” that is to be premiered by the end of 2016.</p><p>Besides being a regular in series and films, Lee has also recorded two albums: “My Everything” (2013) and “Song For You” (2014). Although he stated that doesn’t have plans to pursue a music career, Lee went on an Asian tour to meet his fans in cities such as Yokohama, Osaka, Shanghai, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Taipei, which probably added to his net worth. He is not only popular in South Korea, but also in big part of Asia, having won the online poll in 2014 and 2015 for the hottest Asian actor and being called “Asian Male God”. As of 2013, Lee even has his wax figure at the Madame Tussauds in Shanghai.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Lee Min-ho dated “City Hunter” co-worker Park Min-young, but their relationship didn’t last long.
