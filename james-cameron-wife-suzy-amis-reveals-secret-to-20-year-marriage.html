And having interests together,” the former model exclusively told&nbsp;Closer Weekly. “All of our business ventures are seen through a plant based lens. So we actually have a pulse pressure fractionation plant in Saskatchewan and are making, I’m actually making OMD food products. So we’re doing just that and working with farmers and making sure that the soil is taken care of and people are being taken care of and the planet is being taken off. It’s a passion that we share.” It is pretty clear that the power couple is also all about being healthy, even when it comes to their nightly dinners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/James-Cameron-Suzy-Amis-Marriage-Secret.jpg><p>“We both love soup. So, and I, I have a tendency to just make miso and just throw whatever veggies I can in there and that sort of thing,” the environmental advocate explained. “Hummus and veggies and, but we actually, there are so many dishes. I really just love veggies themselves … but we’ve got comfort food, you know, that’s recognizable. There are the burgers, we have taco night, we have burrito night, we do sushi, we do, you know, big stews and chilies and things like that. I put all of those recipes into the book that I wrote called OMD.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar</a> winner and his love tied the knot in 2000. They share three kids — daughters Claire, 18, and Elizabeth, 12, and son Quinn, 15. James also has another child, Josephine, 26, from a previous marriage to actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Linda Hamilton</strong></a>. However, while they are quite busy with their children, the Hollywood mega-star and his partner in crime do find some alone time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/James-Cameron-Suzy-Amis-Marriage-Secret-3.jpg><p>“We never go out on date night. We never go out. We go and hide from the kids,” Suzy joked.
