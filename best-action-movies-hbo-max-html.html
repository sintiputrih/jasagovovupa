The Max (<a href=#>formerly HBO Max</a>) selection of action flicks is predictably dense, bringing in some of the <a href=#>DC Universe</a>, classic genre movies, and modern hits. Everyone from Martin Campbell to Martin Scorsese can find a home here, and you’ll often find a Batman, too. We will update this list regularly to give readers a new action movie to watch whenever they need a fix, or a reminder to watch a classic they’ve already seen.</p><h2 class=article-sidebar-headline>How We Pick Our Films</h2><p class="article-sidebar-teaser clay-paragraph"></p><p class=article-sidebar-byline data-editable=bylines></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clomyo1iy000i3b71zakr888w@published data-word-count=102>Critic Brian Tallerico watches and writes about movies and TV every day. To curate this list, he dives into Max’s catalogue every month to surface exciting, white-knuckle action titles — using his taste and a lifetime of cinema study as his guide, instead of whatever the algorithm happens to be pushing. After triple-checking to make sure they’re still available, he watches each and writes his recommendation. We highlight more than just the thrilling crowdpleasers: Filmmakers use action to punctuate drama, lighten or heighten the mood of a movie, and explosively make an impact on cinema.

Night Shyamalan’s best film remains this story of an unexpected hero, a man who gets into a car crash and discovers that he may not be like most ordinary men. Bruce Willis is great in the lead role, his stoicism balanced by a fun performance from Samuel L. Jackson as his worldly opposite. Follow it up with the sequel Glass, which isn’t currently streaming for subscribers anywhere but is widely available for rent or purchase.</p>Unbreakable <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>watch on max</a><p class=disclaimer-text data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/disclaimer-text/instances/cl6qmccom000b3b6vle8vm6gn@published>All recommendations are made independently by our editors.
