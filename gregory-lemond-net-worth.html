Over time he invested in multiple real estate.</p><p>The cyclist has a mansion in Minnesota designed by architect Ken Durr. It was a Georgian-style mansion built-in 1988.</p><p>Likewise, this luxurious mansion featured six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, and three half-baths. The real estate covered an area of over 11,550 square feet of space.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gregory-LeMond-2.jpg><p>Yet, he relocated his family to the Minnesota home and stayed to compete in Europe.</p><p>In 2008, Greg’s controversy with Lance Armstrong produced backlash for him. Hence, they left their mansion in Belgium to Minnesota to heal.</p><h3>Investments</h3><p>In 2002, LeMond invested in the exclusive Yellowstone Club. He joined with his five close family and friends for this investment as partners.</p><p>Each of the five partners paid $750,000 to Blixseth for a 1% stake. Greg also owned a home at the resort and bought several building lots.</p><p>However, things turned ugly for Greg in this investment too. In 2006, Greg and partners sued Blixseth for $39 million and other terms.</p><p>Greg and his family relocated from Minnesota to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 2017.

But, he didn’t sustain serious injuries.</p><h2>Gregory LeMond | Lifestyle and Vacations</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Gregory Lemond prefers a minimal lifestyle. He loves to live sparely without much attention.</p><p>This reason was why he moved from Europe to Minnesota right after his retirement. He felt the attention he got in Belgium was too much for him.</p><p>Similarly, health is the biggest priority for an athlete like him. He loves working out consistently and inspires others to do the same.</p><p>Likewise, Greg believes in organic growth over strength gained by pills and drugs.</p><p>In his book “The Science of Fitness,” he revealed no pill could achieve the results of exercising daily.</p><p>Per his interview with “The Roble,” he admitted consuming almost 6000-1000 calories a day. However, after his retirement, he has based his diet on his book.</p><h3>Vacations</h3><p>Despite his retirement from cycling, Greg is still active in major cycling events. He visits them as an interviewer or spectator.</p><p>Greg was recently seen climbing the Col D’Izoard. It is a famous pass in the mountain alps of France. Col D’Izoard has been home to key moments in the Tour de France.</p><p>Despite his retirement from cycling, Greg is active in major cycling events.

He spent a warm afternoon hiking the terrain.</p><h2>Gregory LeMond | Charity</h2><p>Many might have no idea, but Greg was sexually exploited for several years by his uncle. Then, he saw him jailed for sexually assaulting another child.</p><p>Thus, LeMond had decided to help the male victims of child sex abuse. Hence, Greg is a founding board member “of 1in6.org,” a non-profit organization.</p><p>It is dedicated to helping male victims who have had abusive experiences. Greg is a front runner in helping these victims live healthier and happier lives.</p><p>Accordingly, when Greg settled his lawsuits, they donated $200,000 to the foundation.</p><p>Similarly, Greg represented in the Get Back Challenge Cycle in June 2013. He helped raise money for the Limerick Sports Partnership in this event.</p><p>Likewise, in 2016, Greg returned to La Crosse for a charity event. “Ride with Greg” was a polio fundraiser featuring riding with Greg LeMond for 30$.</p><h3>Foundation and Merch&nbsp;</h3><p>In 2018, Greg agreed to serve on the Velodrome Development Foundation.

He seemed to be a strong endorser, which he continued into his post-career as an investor.</p><p>During his time at ADR, Greg was sponsored by a beer company named Coors Light for American races. Also, many cycle companies were waiting for his signature.</p><p>Hence, Greg has had no trouble securing sponsorship deals. Yet something was different about the way he approached the deals.</p><p>He worked with the companies directly rather than a monetary endorsement. Hence, there aren’t many sponsorships. Instead, he would interact and invest in the advanced technology himself.</p><h3>Investments</h3><h4>Carbon Fibers Cycle</h4><p>Greg won a majority of his Tour De France wins on a Carbon fiber cycle. Hence, in 1990 he founded LeMond bicycles.</p><p>The idea was to create devices for him to ride.

Yet, the company ultimately went bankrupt because of poor management by his father.</p><p>Consequently, Carbonframes and his company parted ways. It had only been two years since the start of their partnership.</p><p>LeMond struck a licensing deal with Trek Bicycle Corporation in 1995. The agreement would allow the company to produce and sell bicycles built by LeMond.</p><p>Per NY Daily News, this production process brought Trek over $100 million in sales. As a result, it was renewed several times over 13 years.</p><h4>Controversies in Investment</h4><p>In July 2001, LeMond fell out with Trek. He publicly criticized the relationship between Michele Ferrari and Lance Armstrong. But Lance was Trek’s star athlete.</p><p>As a result, Trek felt Greg’s public remarks damaged the brand. Then, they pressured Greg to apologize.</p><p>Yet, over time the relationship went from bad to worse. Consequently, Trek was sued in March 2008 by LeMond Cycling Inc.</p><p>Greg believed Trek hadn’t advertised and distribute the LeMond brand after his remark.</p><p>In April 2008, Trek decided to drop their deal with LeMond Bikes. After few years of lawsuits, Greg acquired the LeMond bikes name.</p><p>And Trek donated $200,000 to his foundation per settlement.</p><h3>New Partnership</h3><p>In September 2013, LeMond revealed that he was partnering with French company Time. He wanted to return to the bicycle production and sales market as soon as possible.</p><p>Hence, the new line started with a collection of commemorative-themed bicycles.</p><p>The products were a huge success in the early markets. Consequently, Time Sport USA was bought by Greg.</p><h4>Fitness and Revolution</h4><p>Everyone knew Greg to be an athlete with the toughest endurance levels. Therefore, LeMond Fitness Inc. was founded in 2002 by Greg and Bernie Boglioli to help other athletes.</p><p>The idea for this investment was to help individuals meet their fitness goals. Also, they allowed athletes to practice effectively.</p><p>Hoist Fitness bought a stake in this company in 2012. Then, they announced plans to relocate its headquarters to San Diego, California.</p><p>Over time Greg saw potential in the stakes he sold. So, he bought the LeMond Revolution from Hoist in late 2012.</p><p>Accordingly, Greg relaunched it in Minneapolis with a new management team. Later, he invested in LeMond LLC to launch a line of products.</p><p>In late 2012, LeMond purchased the LeMond Revolution from Hoist, relaunching with a new management team in Minneapolis.</p><h4>Restaurant&nbsp;</h4><p>Greg was making constant investments at the peak of his career. In 1990, Greg invested in “Scott Kee’s Tour de France,” located on France Avenue.</p><p>It was a family-based restaurant which had been his dream for a long time.&nbsp; Further, Greg also invested in several bagel-based bakery cafes.</p><h4>New Technologies</h4><p>Greg created LeMond Composites in 2016. He aimed to produce high-volume, low-cost carbon fiber composites.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Greg-LeMond-3-1024x704.jpg><p>This business venture was an immense success. Consequently, Greg received funding from the Australian Government of AU of $2.5 million.</p><p>They wanted to construct a carbon fiber manufacturing plant in Australia.</p><h3>Book Publications</h3><p>Amongst others, “The Science of Fitness” is one such book authored by Greg LeMond and Dr. Mark Hom.</p><p>The book is dedicated to portraying the relationship between exercise, nutrition, and physiology. So, it is considered a must-read for both experienced and amateur athletes.</p><p>Similarly, “The Comeback: Greg LeMond” is another book written about him. Daniel de Vise authored this book. Accordingly, he tries to give us a vivid account of Greg’s life in a nutshell.</p><p>It was originally published in 1998. This book was his reaction to challenges and allegations Greg faced during his career.</p><p>Additionally, Greg wrote “Greg LEM Pckt Noncomb” himself.
