It was later proved by a DNA test.</p><p id=eJhVj4v92R5 data-wc=24>"When there are just two of you, there's less falling out and stomping off because there's not really anywhere to go. There's just us.</p><p id=eO-oPl3LDbN data-wc=48>"We have completely separate lives in some ways, and there are, of course, private areas, but we've become a very strong team. For some things, we're each other's confidants; for other things, we're each other's best friends, the person the other one most wants to tell things to."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ccd6f8c0612f-liz-hurley-damian.jpg><p id=ePbCFYBHILC data-wc=27>Adds Damian: "We have a twin-like telepathy, and I think that serves us very well.
