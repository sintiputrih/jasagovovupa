His mother, Elizabeth Brotons Rodríguez, decided to flee Cuba with her boyfriend and Elián, leaving behind a country plagued by economic hardship. Tragically, their makeshift boat capsized, and Elián’s mother drowned. Elián was found by two fishermen off the coast of Florida and was taken in by his relatives in Miami.</p><h2 id=the-custody-battle-dTmNmkeRlV>The Custody Battle</h2><p>The custody battle for Elián was a highly publicized event. His Miami relatives wanted to keep him in the United States, believing it offered him a better future. However, his father, Juan Miguel González, wanted him returned to Cuba. The case became a political issue, with Cuban leader Fidel Castro demanding Elián’s return. After a protracted legal battle, Elián was returned to his father in Cuba in June 2000.</p><h2 id=life-in-cuba-dTmNmkeRlV>Life in Cuba</h2><p>Upon his return to Cuba, Elián was hailed as a national hero.
