Imagine the horror, the fear, and the agony. It had to be like a horror movie,” added the expert, who believes that everything happened during 48 to 71 seconds of free fall.</p><p>During that time, the group was aware of the seriousness of the situation, he said.</p><p>​“In that period of time, they are realizing everything. And what’s more, in complete darkness. It’s difficult to get an idea of what they experienced in those moments,” Martín wrote.</p><p>​“As it fell to the depths of the ocean, the hull would have been subjected to a sudden increase in underwater pressure” — leading to a “powerful compression” of the sub’s carbon-fiber hull at a depth of around 9,000 feet, ​he continued.</p><p>​The rapid contraction of the hull “would have been out of step with what was happening to the [acrylic] material of the viewport — leading to a micro-fissure and implosion,” Martín said.</p><p>“After those 48 seconds, or one minute, the implosion and instantaneous sudden death occurs,” the expert added.</p><p>Structural issues with the hull have been cited among the causes of the deadly implosion.</p><p>Virginia Tech ocean engineering professor Stefano Brizzolara has suggested that the vessel’s pressure hull could have had a defect that may have fractured under the immense pressure.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, who perished in the disaster, has come under intense scrutiny over the company’s safety protocols. <span class=credit>Arnie Weissmann/Travel Weekly via AP</span></figure><p>“It is difficult to say what caused the structural failure in this case, but any small material and geometric imperfection, misalignment of connection flanges, tightening torque of bolted connection may have started the structural collapse,” <a href=#>Brizzolara told The Post </a>recently.</p><p>Brizzolara said carbon fiber is “very prone to possible defects” and that it “exhibits a more fragile behavior” than other materials.</p><p>The expert said any small leak at the extreme depth would have sent water gushing in at a speed of about 620 mph, killing everyone instantly.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The ill-fated Titan submersible was destroyed on June 18. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>OceanGate CEO and Titan pilot Stockton Rush, 61, French Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, British billionaire Hamish Harding, 58, prominent Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, and his 19-year-old son, Sulaiman Dawood, all died in the disaster.</p><p>OceanGate has declined to comment since the tragedy&nbsp;and <a href=#>suspended all exploratory and commercial operations</a> amid intense criticism of Rush for what some perceive as&nbsp;<a href=#>lax attitudes about safety</a>&nbsp;that may have contributed to the accident.</p><p>In 2021, Rush said he would “like to be remembered as an innovator” <a href=#>during an interview</a>&nbsp;with Mexican travel blogger Alan Estrada.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think it was Gen. [Douglas] MacArthur who said, ‘You’re remembered for the rules you break,’” he said. “You know I’ve broken some rules to make this [the Titan].
