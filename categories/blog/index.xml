今でも個性派として、音楽だけでなく人間味でも関心を引く魅力的な方です。
５０歳を超えた現在も、高身長で細身のスタイルを保ち、
ボーカルの櫻井さんとともにBUCK-TICKのライブの中心にいます。
そんな今井さんは、櫻井さんと同じく、
長く独身貴族を貫いていました。
結婚は櫻井さんよりも早い、
２００８年という時期・・・。
当時は先を越された感がありましたが、
今では互いに嫁持ちということで、
メイン２人の私生活の変化に時代を感じます。
今井寿(BUCK-TICK)に嫁と子供はいる？ ２００８年の５月にファンに結婚を発表した今井寿さん。
当時は、ファンも祝福モードで、櫻井さんの時ほどの意外性はありませんでした。
そして、結婚した嫁さんとの間には、
すでに子供も誕生しているようです！
今井は「8月某日 家族が増えました。第一子誕生ってヤツです」と短く明かすと、「もっと、何かいろいろとブログで書くんだろうな・・ と、自分で思ってたけど、何も出てこないです。何も（笑）」とユーモアを交えて報告。引用元：http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2028016/full/
自身のブログの中での報告ということで、
週刊誌よりも先にファンに伝わるという最高の形でした。
自分の心境を素直に書くブログは好評で、
子供の誕生の際にも、本当はもっと色々書きたかった様子。
しかし、この子供に関しては、
性別や名前などは一切明らかになっていません。
もしかしたら、今井さんのブログを辿れば、
どこかに書いてるかも？とは思いますが・・・。
嫁さんとその姉貴さんは、
震災の際に、善意ある行動をされて話題となりました。
その嫁さんの姉さんは恵比寿のバーにいる方らしく、
過去には今井さんがブログで紹介されていました。
また、姉さんはブログもやっており、
そのブログも紹介されています。
ブログを見てる限り、かなり綺麗な方・・、
そして今井さんの嫁さんも絶対に美人でしょうね・・・。
仲の良い美人姉妹って、なんか羨ましいですよね。
って、女性ファンからの嫉妬を煽らないか心配になります！笑
今井寿(BUCK-TICK)に逮捕された過去 意外と知られてないですが、
今井さんには、逮捕された過去があります。
１９８９年４月当時、
バクチクも全盛期で、
かなり大きく報道されました。
ただ、容疑の内容は、
アスカさんほど酷い内容ではなく、
当時のバンドマンの常識の範囲では、
「ちょっと悪い」ぐらいの内容だったと思います。
裁判の際には、
今井さん見たさに、
多くのファンが駆けつけ、
まるでライブ会場の前のような、
異様な雰囲気になっていたそうです。
それでもバクチクメンバーは、
神妙な会見を開き、自分のことのように謝罪。
このバンドメンバーの団結力というか、
連帯責任が強いバンドあることが、また素敵に思えました。
もちろん、今井さんも深く反省し、
その後のライブでも今まで以上に熱心なパフォーマンスを披露してました。
過去には雑誌で、独房について語ることもあり、
当時のことを隠そうとも思ってないようです。
素直で気持ちの良い性格が、
この逮捕の後の発言でわかります。
独特な音楽性に加えて、
個性的な性格、生活感が、
今井寿さんのカリスマ性に繋がっているのでしょう！
