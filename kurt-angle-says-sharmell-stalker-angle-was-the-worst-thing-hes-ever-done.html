The Olympic Gold Medalist has been a part of a lot of great television segments and matches. A lengthy career that began back in 1998 has also led to some moments that Angle would rather forget.</p><p>Angle answered a fan question on his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kurt Angle Show</a> about the storyline where he stalked <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Booker T</a>‘s wife, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sharmell</a>. He responded that the entire thing made him feel uncomfortable. He thought there were unnecessary racial undertones, as well.</p><p>“I have no idea where the idea came from. Vince (McMahon) is kind of a ribber. He’ll do stuff to mess with you a little bit and shove it in your face. I think that he thought I had this fetish for black women. I like all women, white, black, hispanic, it doesn’t matter. My wife is half Hispanic and half Italian. I think Vince thought I had this fetish for black women and he thought it would be a funny program. I was not comfortable by any means. I had so much respect for Booker T and Sharmell. To do that and pretend I was stalking his wife, it was the worst angle I have ever done. It was the worst storyline I’ve ever done. I did it anyway because I’ve always been a team player, but I was not comfortable doing it.”</p><p>While Angle wasn’t a fan of the on-screen stalking segments, he did give his approval to the overall on-screen pairing of Booker and Sharmell. He said together, the pair was unstoppable.</p><p>“They were incredible. Very entertaining. Sharmell never missed a spot. She was on all the time. She had great timing. Booker T is one of the best wrestlers I’ve ever got in the ring with. Those two together are unstoppable.”</p><p>Kurt Angle was also on the infamous “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">plane ride from hell</a>.” He’s seen a lot of crazy things in his career in pro wrestling. In addition to his spot in the WWE Hall of Fame, he has held world championships in both WWE and Impact. He was ranked the greatest wrestler in the world in the 2001 PWI 500.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What did you think of the Angle – Sharmell storyline?
