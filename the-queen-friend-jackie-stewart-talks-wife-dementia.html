"I'm lucky that I was a racing driver and I can afford to have nurses and the neuro nurses that I've got looking after Helen," said the Formula One racing driver.

Very few people can afford that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/54ff6dc746de-sir-jackie-stewart-and-his-wife-helen-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eG8v90fH_cPi data-wc=11><strong>The racing legend and his wife Helen attended Wimbledon last week</strong></p><p id=eAf29D8S7R23 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Royal fans will get to see Prince George next week</a></strong></p><p id=eDh3h1cNT-Js data-wc=58>Sir Jackie set up Race Against Dementia in 2018.
