She then demonstrated her acting abilities while touring with the troupe. She was also posing for numerous advertising campaigns at the same time. After her family relocated to Los Angeles, she began auditioning for various film and television roles. Taylor Dooley was ultimately chosen to play a pivotal role in “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl” in the mid-2000s.
