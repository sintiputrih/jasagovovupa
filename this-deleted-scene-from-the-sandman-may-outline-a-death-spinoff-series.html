The streaming service, which also produces the hit dark fantasy series, has released a deleted scene from one of the show’s most popular episodes, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sound of Her Wings</a>.” And if that wasn’t enough of a visit from Father Christmas, the scene may even be a backdoor pilot for a Death spinoff miniseries.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Since it's the holidays, here's a gift for fans of The Sandman:</p><p>This is a deleted scene from The Sound of Her Wings. It gives us a little more insight into why Death is the way she is. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/orPRqUZ5v6</a></p>— Netflix (@netflix) <a href=#>December 21, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=812 data-injectable=true>The deleted scene contains a few items of interest for longtime fans of Neil Gaiman’s Sandman comic series that ran between 1989 and 1996 and provides the source material for the television adaption. The scene takes place between Morpheus, aka Dream, and his older sister Death as he accompanies her during the course of her duties. Fans will immediately recognize one of Dream’s first lines, “Why do they fear the sunless lands?” as one of the most famous lines from the acclaimed comic.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Day 47 – Nov 1st <a href=#>#RenewSandman</a> <a href=#>@netflix</a> Death: The High Cost of Living <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZaiNYzU4U1</a></p>— COREY ⏳ POSTING SANDMAN CONTENT UNTIL S2 & BEYOND (@lokitty_supreme) <a href=#>November 1, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>But the true revelation is when Death reveals the secret to her surprisingly upbeat attitude and her approach to her responsibilities. Death describes the death of a young girl “a long time ago” who asks, upon her arrival, “How would you like it?” She then reveals that in the years following, she resolved to take a day every one hundred years to live for 24 hours as a mortal.</p><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>While Death’s revelation explains much about the character’s motivations, there is something even more enlightening for longtime fans. Death is essentially describing the plot of her own solo miniseries, Death: The High Cost of Living, one of the best-loved spinoffs of the many spinoffs from the original comic series. In it, Death spends one day as an eccentric, orphaned&nbsp;goth teenager named Didi. In it, she experiences a wide variety of experiences and helps an adolescent teen named Sexton to appreciate his own life.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>While it’s hardly an explicit promise for any upcoming Netflix Death series, it is at least an outline of the concept — and probably the most likely spinoff of the show. Fans are good a believing in miracles, though. If they managed to wait through the seemingly endless wait for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a season 2 greenlight</a>, they can wait on Death herself, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMisZJ2dnJrBprCMrJqeppVis7O7zGaroZ1dqK6vsMyapWalka56sMHTpaCnnV2WeqWxwK2fZqugnruwssVmqp6qmZrAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
