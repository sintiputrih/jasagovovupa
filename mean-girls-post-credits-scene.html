With the latest DCEU installment arriving in cinemas on December 22, 2023, it begs the question of&nbsp;<a href=#>whether Mean Girls has a post-credit scene</a> because we all want to know if we need to hang around until the absolute end.</p><p>Mean Girls is a 2004 movie written by comedian Tina Fey and is hailed as a cult classic for its iconic lines and as a high school dramedy. In 2017, Fey adapted the movie into a hit Broadway musical and announced in 2020 that, in turn, would be adapted into a movie. (Cue that 30 Rock joke here.) However, it’s technically a reboot adaptation with young cast members like <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1391164/the-last-thing-he-told-me-ending/>Angourie Rice</a>, Renée Rapp, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1271451/aulii-cravalho/>Aull’i Cravahlo</a>, Christopher Briney, Bebe Wood, and Jaquel Spivey. Fey reprises her role as Ms. Norbury and Tim Meadows reprises his role as Principal Duvall.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bebewoodinterview.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lindsay-lohan-mean-girls.jpg><p>Fey talked about the <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/movies/mean-girls-tina-fey.html>young cast</a> in the new movie to The New York Times. “We learned so much with the [stage] show that there doesn’t have to be rigidity in the casting of these roles, in terms of what they look like and how they identify. This story works in many interesting permutations. Anyone with charisma is a good Regina. Anyone who looks like they might come apart can be a great Gretchen.”</p><p>Indeed, any movie can have a post-credits scene these days. Here’s if you need to hang around until the end of <a href=#>Mean Girls for a post-credits scene</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=does-mean-girls-have-a-post-credits-scene>Does Mean Girls have a post-credits scene?</h2><p><a href=#>Does Mean Girls have a post-credits scene</a>? Yes, there is a little treat if you hang around until the end, but unfortunately, it doesn’t elude to any sequels. It’s just a cute little touch. <strong>Spoilers ahead.</strong></p><p>After the credits roll, Regina, Gretchen, and Karen turn around and look directly at the camera/audience. “You’re next,” Regina says. “You’d be really hot if we changed, like, everything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mean-girls.jpg><p>On the topic of sequels, though, the original Damian (Daniel Franzese) from the 2004 film said all the cast from his version of the story want a follow-up. “We all want it,” he told People at the premiere of Mean Girls on January 9, 2024. “You got to tell the boss lady [Tina Fey] over there. I’m sure [she’s] heard it a million times, but she’s the gatekeeper, so we’re all waiting.” He added that he was still close with the original cast members. “We all talk when we can,” he explained. “It’s very difficult. We were all really busy, but I love them also.”</p><p>On November 1, 2023, Walmart&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>uncovered the first of a series</a>&nbsp;of commercials featuring members of the cast of the 2004 movie&nbsp;Mean Girls&nbsp;reprising their roles. Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, Lacey Chabert, Daniel Franzese, and Rajiv Surendra all reunited nearly two decades after the release of the original film to promote Walmart’s Black Friday savings deals. They’re all grown up and have adult jobs with kids but are still trying to navigate their way through North Shore High School.</p><p>“Some things never change. On Wednesdays we wear pink, but now we shop Walmart Black Friday deals,” Lindsay Lohan (who plays protagonist Cady Heron)<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;says in the ad</a>, while Lacey Chabert (who plays Gretchen Weiners) pulls up in a convertible to greet her high school aged daughter with Walmart bags. There’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>several throwbacks</a>&nbsp;in the video like the iconic “Jingle Bell Rock” performance, Amanda Seyfried’s character Karen Smith predicting the weather, Rajiv Surendra’s character Kevin Gnapoor amping his kid up for high school, and a heartfelt reunion of Daniel Franzese as Damien Leigh and Cady Heron.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mean-girls.jpg><p>However, the internet noticed one certain Plastic—nay the queen of The Plastics—was missing: Regina George (played by Rachel McAdams). One person&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>wrote on X</a>&nbsp;(formerly Twitter), “Rachel mcadams was too good to answer her phone??????” Another&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>posted</a>, “Rachel McAdams returned as Regina George when she said “No” to a Walmart ad.”</p><p>After the ad came out, an insider told Page Six, “Rachel McAdams didn’t want to do it.” The source continued, “They were all offered it. But the three of them loved being together for their reunion. They had a great time talking about being moms, and it was definitely a loss not having Rachel there.”</p><p>Though she wasn’t seen in the ad, McAdams has been vocal about returning with her fellow&nbsp;Mean Girls&nbsp;cast and even making a cameo in the new&nbsp;Mean Girls&nbsp;movie based on the hit Broadway Musical. “I don’t see a way to shoehorn us in,” McAdams told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Bustle</a>&nbsp;in an interview about the movie musical hitting Paramount+, but she added, “If Tina can figure it out, I’m there, for sure.”</p><p><strong>Mean Girls is in cinemas now.</strong></p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
