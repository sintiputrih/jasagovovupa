She was encouraged to use her voice, regardless of who the audience before her was. It is this strength that has allowed the Pitch Perfect 2 star to transcend from child to adult actor seamlessly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I've had a lot of incredible women in my life from a very young age," Steinfeld explained to People. "So, I've never had a problem speaking up for myself. It starts with my mom and my grandmother. I have my cousins who I've always felt like I could look up to. They're incredible mothers and incredible businesswomen."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Did Hailee Steinfeld's Mom Force Her Into Acting?</a></span></p><p>This strength is what has kept Steinfeld from being afraid to tackle new projects. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">And that strength, according to the Bumblebee star, all started by having supportive parents.</a></p><p>"]My parents] have truly instilled in me the notion that you can make anything happen if you work for it," Steinfeld said. "As long as you believe in yourself, you work hard and are passionate, persistent and prepared, you can do anything."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being this driven and strong can be off-putting to some. This is why Steinfeld surrounds herself with other strong women in the industry to ensure she never loses that grit that has allowed Steinfeld to be fearless in life.</p><h2 id=the-friends-hailee-steinfeld-keeps-are-both-mentally-and-physically-strong>The Friends Hailee Steinfeld Keeps Are Both Mentally And Physically Strong</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift.jpg><p>When Steinfeld landed the role of Kate Bishop in Hawkeye, she did not have to audition for it. <a href=# rel=nofollow>A fact that thrilled Marvel fans to no end</a>. But the best part of working on Hawkeye was meeting Florence Pugh, who quickly became part of Steinfeld's inner circle.</p><p>"I'll never forget the moment I met Florence," Steinfeld explained to People. "Watching Florence walk on set like she had been there since day one was incredibly exciting and inspiring. She is so wickedly talented and has the best sense of humor. It's just amazing to be around."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps one of the strongest friends that the Spider-Man: Across the Spider Verse star has though is Swift. But had it not been for a brief meeting years ago at a pre-Oscars party, the two may never have become friends. Nor would Steinfeld have starred in the infamous Bad Blood video.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>'Hawkeye': Hailee Steinfeld Spills What She Thinks Of Kate Bishop Meeting Yelena</a></span></p><p>"It was the coolest to be a part of her music video with so many incredibly talented, empowering women. There were three of me that day, too, which was quite cool. To be a part of Taylor's world and her vision was an honor, truly."</p><p>Now that Steinfeld is in her mid-twenties, she has positioned herself as an actress who is not only a consummate professional but one who will also not be pushed around. And this can all be traced back to consciously keeping company with those who build Steinfeld up and encourage her rather than those who want to tear her down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqGcmrJuv9OeoKeelaGxbr7Er5yapKNiwKmxjK6lmqifobyosdOimpqknK56tMHRq6auppSoeqmx0aycpZ5drLa1tIysq6unnpx6uLvMnqVmoZ6YubawyKeeZqyRrrmwvoysrqKepGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
