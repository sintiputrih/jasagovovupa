While it draws inspiration from his own parents, he emphasized that it is not a direct reflection of his life.

Its unique blend of crime, comedy, and drama, and its use of Buffalo as a backdrop contribute to its lasting appeal in independent cinema.</p><p>The story of Buffalo ’66 follows Billy Brown, who has just completed a five-year prison term and introduces Layla, a tap dancer he kidnaps, as his wife to his dysfunctional parents. Throughout the film, Layla witnesses the troubled relationship between Billy and his parents and the reasons behind Billy’s prison time.</p><p>After events involving revenge and a journey, Billy and Layla confess their love for each other. However, driven by revenge, Billy leaves Layla in the middle of the night. He later reconciles with a friend and returns to Layla, symbolizing a newfound connection and a hopeful future.</p><p>To watch “Buffalo ’66,” you can rent or buy it on Google Play, Vudu, iTunes, and Amazon.
