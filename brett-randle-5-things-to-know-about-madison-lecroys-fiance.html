I am so excited and I feel like I’ve been trying to hold this in for quite some time and it has been one of the hardest things I’ve had to do.”</p><p class=p1>At the time, the hairstylist noted that she and her beau were not in a rush to walk down the aisle.</p><p class=p1>“Even though I was married in the past, I had <a href=#>never tried on a wedding dress</a>. I had never done any of that. This is really the first time that I’m going to be a bride, so I’m going to take my time,” she told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “[He] has a large family and so do I. So we’re gonna probably keep it under a hundred [guests] if we can, which is going to be hard to do.”</p><p class=p1>The salon owner, who first revealed <a href=#>the news of her engagement</a> during an Amazon Live broadcast, revealed that <a href=#>Randle enlisted her 8-year-old son, Hudson, to help plan</a> the proposal. The elementary schooler, whom LeCroy shares with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Josh Hughes</strong></a>, wanted his mom to have an elaborate engagement complete with a limousine. As a result, Randle hired one to take the new family of three to dinner on Kiawah Island, South Carolina.</p><p class=p1>“I’m like, ‘All right, this is weird,’” the Bravo personality&nbsp;recalled. “My son’s dressed up, but my son, like, won’t look at me in the face.”</p><p class=p1>However, an unexpected rainstorm meant <a href=#>the California native’s big question</a> was delayed.</p><p class=p1>“He proposed to me in the living room, and my son’s behind him, just clapping,” LeCroy told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;at the time. “I completely, like, blacked out at the point of whatever he was saying. I had no idea. … It was perfect.”</p><p class=p1>Hours after her Amazon Live announcement on Thursday, LeCroy shared a black-and-white photo of the couple via <a href=#>Instagram</a>, writing, “When you know you know <span class=s1>🤍</span>.”</p><p class=p1>The reality TV personality and Randle first <a href=#>took their love Instagram official in June</a> after she <a href=#>previously hinted in April that she was seeing someone new</a> after prior <a href=#><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong> romance speculation.</a></p><p class=p1>“Madhappy,” LeCroy captioned a series of pics of the pair as they cuddled up on a boat ride, posing for selfies and sharing kisses.</p><p class=p1>Weeks later, the Bravo star exclusively revealed to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that<a href=#> the pair had instant chemistry upon meeting</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“A little over two months ago I was visiting Scottsdale, Arizona, with a bunch of my girlfriends for a Bachelorette party. He was there for a friend’s birthday party,” she explained in June. “I did not know him at this time, but I go into this bar and <a href=#>we immediately lock eyes</a> from across the room. It was, like, instant. And I mean you really can’t miss him. … He’s absolutely stunning.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to learn more about the man who swept LeCroy off her feet:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7Ox061kq5membmmeZRmq6GhnpzAbsDOZqKnp6dirqO71K1kppmUnsCwuoylnJyqn67AbrLImqWcnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
