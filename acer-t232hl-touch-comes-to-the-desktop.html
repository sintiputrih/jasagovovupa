As those first two systems are primarily touch-oriented, desktop computers are suddenly seeing a large number of touch displays appearing. In an environment that is used to a keyboard and mouse for input, how well is touch going to fit into that setting?</p><p>The availability of touchscreens has rapidly increased with the launch of Windows 8 last year. Where touchscreens were rare or expensive before, now they are much easier to find with the availability of a mainstream, touch-oriented operating system. The first one that I have had a chance to use for an extended period is the T232HL from Acer, a 23” 1080p display with an IPS panel and a glossy screen finish.</p><p>There is a kickstand in the back to adjust the angle of the screen, but no other ergonomic adjustments are available. On my review sample the kickstand was too tight and I had to remove the cover to loosen the mechanism, but this might not happen on the shipping units. There are 100mm VESA mounting holes, if you wish to have more adjustments or get the display off your desk.</p><p>The inputs are limited to HDMI, DVI, and DSub, with no DisplayPort to be found. With DisplayPort being more and more common now, and the Acer selling for around $500, I think adding a DP input would be appropriate. There is also a 3.5mm audio input for the internal speakers, and a USB 3.0 hub with three ports on the left side of the display. It also uses an exterior power brick, a big pet peeve of mine.</p><p>Being an IPS panel, the viewing angles are very good on the Acer T232HL. The problematic issue is the glossy finish of the screen that reflects a lot of light. The glossy finish might help to hide fingerprints from using the touch features, or it might be necessary due to the touch sensors, but it makes that angle adjustment even more important as you try to eliminate reflections. You can see the reflection that is present in the lower-angle shot, as for all the other shots I worked hard to find an angle where reflections were less visible.</p><p>I mistakenly forgot to capture images of the on-screen display before returning the display to Acer, so unfortunately I had to resort to pulling images of the OSD from the manual to provide examples of how it works. Screen controls are mounted to the right side of the display, with an OSD that pops up once you press a button. This sort of arrangement has been my favorite from Dell, but in that case the buttons are mounted right beside the screen and it is clear which label applies to which button. In this case with them hidden to the side, I often hit the wrong button when making an adjustment.</p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=505><tbody readability=7.9541547277937><tr height=13><td colspan=2 height=13><strong>Acer T232HL</strong></td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Video Inputs</strong></td><td>HDMI, DVI, Dsub</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Panel Type</strong></td><td>IPS</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Pixel Pitch</strong></td><td>0.265 mm</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Colors</strong></td><td>16.7 million</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Brightness</strong></td><td>250 nits</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Contrast Ratio</strong></td><td>1000:1 Typical</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Response Time</strong></td><td>5ms GTG</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Viewable Size</strong></td><td>23"</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1920x1080</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Viewing Angle (H/V)</strong></td><td>178/178</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Backlight</strong></td><td>LED</td></tr><tr height=13 readability=2><td height=13><strong>Power Consumption (operation)</strong></td><td>25 Watts</td></tr><tr height=13 readability=2><td height=13><strong>Power Consumption (standby)</strong></td><td>0.5 Watts</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Screen Treatment</strong></td><td>Glossy</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Height-Adjustable</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Tilt</strong></td><td>Yes, 8-60 degrees</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Pivot</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Swivel</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>VESA Wall Mounting</strong></td><td>Yes, 100mm</td></tr><tr height=13 readability=2><td height=13><strong>Dimensions w/ Base (WxHxD)</strong></td><td>21.5" x 17.9" x 1.9"</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>12.6 lbs.</td></tr><tr height=13 readability=4><td height=13><strong>Additional Features</strong></td><td>10-point Touch, 3 Port USB 3.0 Hub, Stereo Speakers</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Limited Warranty</strong></td><td>3 Years</td></tr><tr height=13 readability=6><td height=13><strong>Accessories</strong></td><td>DVI cable, HDMI cable, Dsub cable, 3.5mm cable, USB cable</td></tr><tr height=13><td height=13><strong>Price</strong></td><td><a href=#>$500</a> (2/05/2013)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The specifications on the Acer are in line with most 23” IPS displays, except for the additional touch features.
