And that's saying a lot given the fact that <a href=#>1996's Scream has been deemed a "perfect" horror movie</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much of the success of I Know What You Did Last Summer comes down to the cast. While<a href=#> Jennifer Love Hewitt wasn't happy with the success the slasher film brought her career</a>, it really did help launch her career. The rest of the cast already had varying degrees of success at the time the movie was made, most notably Sarah Michelle Gellar.</p><p>Given that most of the stars of I Know What You Did Last Summer were young and experiencing a ton of success, it wouldn't be unreasonable to wonder if they were divas. But that wasn't the experience of Muse Watson, the man who played the k*ller in the film and its sequel.</p><h2 id=muse-watson-became-very-close-with-sarah-michelle-gellar>Muse Watson Became Very Close With Sarah Michelle Gellar</h2><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Vulture</a>, Muse Watson explained that he was hired because he had a reputation for playing a terrifying villain and being a genuinely nice man. This was important to director Jim Gillespie, who wanted both Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar to feel safe on the set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It turned out that Sarah, in particular, felt extremely comfortable with the man who would eventually try to k*ll her onscreen.</p><p>"The first thing I remember about meeting Michelle Gellar is we went on long walks down the beach together," Muse admitted.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sarah Michelle Gellar Was Completely Banned From McDonald's For A Pretty Legitimate Reason</a></span></p><p>"I was kind of like her new uncle. We walked and talked, and it was great," Muse explained to Vulture before claiming they'd speak mostly about business and their careers. But they'd also delve into their family lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We’d tell each other stories about our families. I don’t know why we bonded. I’ll tell you what, everybody on set at first had somebody there with them. And Michelle Gellar didn’t and I didn’t, and I think that might have been why we ended up going to the store or going walking. I think it was just that. And I adore her. She is one of the most intelligent women I’ve ever met in my life."</p><h2 id=jennifer-love-hewitt-39-s-relationship-with-muse-watson>Jennifer Love Hewitt's Relationship With Muse Watson</h2><p>Muse told Vulture that he and Jennifer Love Hewitt lived in the same apartment complex in Burbank prior to being cast in I Know What You Did Last Summer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We weren’t best of friends, but we knew who each other was and spoke to each other at the pool. She was there with her mother. They’d gotten an apartment there to pursue her career. I was tickled to death we got cast together and got to know each other. And after doing [the two movies] together, we did Saturday Night Live, which was just amazing," Muse explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Love Hewitt Has Mixed Feelings About Inappropriate Media Attention After Starring In Heartbreakers</a></span></p><p>"Love, when I met her, she had gone to one of those pottery places where you make gifts for people, and she’d made me something to hang on the wall for the shoot."</p><h2 id=did-muse-watson-keep-in-touch-with-his-co-stars>Did Muse Watson Keep In Touch With His Co-Stars?</h2><p>In his interview with Vulture, Muse waxed poetic about the cast of I Know What You Did Last Summer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I just thought they were all the greatest bunch I’d ever worked with. They’re all such wonderful people, and I hope they have all the happy joy in their life."</p><p>But when asked if he had stayed in touch with any of them, he admitted that he hadn't. His life has been consumed by his autistic daughter and doing work with various autism charities.</p><h2 id=muse-sent-ryan-phillippe-a-quot-creepy-quot-tweet>Muse Sent Ryan Phillippe A "Creepy" Tweet</h2><p>Twenty years after I Know What You Did Last Summer came out, Ryan Phillipe told HuffPost that he received a "creepy" message from Muse.</p><p>On the fourth of July, the date the movie takes place, Muse reportedly sent Ryan a Twitter DM that had something along the lines of "Hello, old friend".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's no doubt in Ryan's mind that Muse was Tweeting in character. But he didn't seem to appreciate it.</p><p>Muse told Vulture that he really didn't mean to creep Ryan out.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Ryan Phillippe Lost Over $1 Million Selling His Home</a></span></p><p>"When I met that boy, I thought that boy had more potential to be the best actor who ever hit Hollywood in the world. He was just the nicest guy in the world," Muse said.</p><p>He then went on to explain, "I haven’t talked to him in years. And I don’t know why I did that. It just seemed like a greeting. I wasn’t in character or nothing. Just Muse Watson. Then I saw on Twitter or Facebook or somewhere, he was telling everybody, 'Ooh, look at this!” And I thought I’d just let him play at it. But I’ll send him something spooky for his birthday or something."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dmK60wIyonWahXaC7sMOMsJ%2BarF2uvLZ5w6KbZqSRqMFuv9SmpJ6qXaC2rbjEq2SmraOaerit06ymp2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
