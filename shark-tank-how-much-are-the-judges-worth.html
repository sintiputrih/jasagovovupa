According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, he is worth an estimated $350 million.</p><p>His riches are mostly due to his being the&nbsp;founder, former CEO, and president of the clothing brand <a href=#>FUBU</a>. Plus, John embodies the entrepreneurial rags-to-riches journey (though John would look dapper in anything)&nbsp;Shark Tank promotes. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he co-founded FUBU, "at his mother's house in Queens when he was 20 years old," sewing many of the items himself.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=#>NBC</a>,&nbsp;"at its pinnacle, FUBU had netted $350 million in sales through 5,000 retail stores,"&nbsp;and it has grossed "more than $6 billion globally"&nbsp;to date. Standing for "For Us, By Us," and targeting "young African American consumers," per the outlet, the duds have been rocked by Beyonce,&nbsp;TLC, and more. It's just a cool brand, and John always keeps his temperature cool on Shark Tank. "I've been really fortunate to have been part of something that's a globally recognized brand,"&nbsp;John told NBC in 2017.&nbsp;"I don't know necessarily the effect or impact that I've had, but whatever it is, I'm grateful."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9laX92e9KhmKujXamur7eMoaawZZ2qsKl5wKucZqyYmnqrwcOgnKxlp6S%2FtbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
