However, their inability to maintain their lead in the latter half of their games is a concern. The Commanders, though slipping to a 2-2, showcased grit by tying the game during crunch time. Injuries to Martin and Dotson could be pivotal in determining their play.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Considering the Bears’ recent form and potential injuries for Washington, Justin Fields might be a valuable pick given his impressive yardage last game.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: It might be a bit risky to rely on Martin and Dotson until their playing status is clarified.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Jacksonville_Jaguars_at_Buffalo_Bills><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars at Buffalo Bills</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Jaguars showed their resilience against the Falcons, and Lawrence seems to be settling in. The Bills, on the other hand, look dominant, and Allen-Diggs seems to be a potent duo.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Allen and Diggs from the Bills due to their recent form. Lawrence might be a value pick from the Jaguars.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Agnew’s injury status needs monitoring, and the potential absence of Tre’Davious White in the Bills secondary might hurt their defense.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Houston_Texans_at_Atlanta_Falcons><strong>Houston Texans at Atlanta Falcons</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Texans, with their recent upset, are looking promising.

The Falcons, though, seem to be struggling, especially in their passing game.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Stroud and Collins from the Texans. Robinson from the Falcons due to his consistent running.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Considering the recent form, relying too much on the Falcons’ passing game might be a risk.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Carolina_Panthers_at_Detroit_Lions><strong>Carolina Panthers at Detroit Lions</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Panthers are struggling, with Young under constant pressure. The Lions, with their win against the Packers, seem to be in better form.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Goff and Montgomery from the Lions. Montgomery’s performance, even when questionable, makes him a notable pick.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Panthers’ offensive line struggles might make their offensive players a risky pick.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Tennessee_Titans_at_Indianapolis_Colts><strong>Tennessee Titans at Indianapolis Colts</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: Henry remains the heart of the Titans’ offense, with his multifaceted role.

The Patriots were notably poor in their last game, and the Saints couldn’t find the end zone against the Buccaneers.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Given the recent performances, there doesn’t seem to be a standout pick.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: The QBs of both teams, until they show some consistency.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Baltimore_Ravens_at_Pittsburgh_Steelers><strong>Baltimore Ravens at Pittsburgh Steelers</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Ravens are flying high, especially with Jackson’s form.

While the Bengals were blanked in the last three-quarters of their recent game, the Cardinals couldn’t maintain their first-half lead against the 49ers.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Given the inconsistent forms, there’s no standout pick. Higgins might be a value pick if he’s fit.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: Until more clarity, relying too much on either team’s passing game might be a risk.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=New_York_Jets_at_Denver_Broncos><strong>New York Jets at Denver Broncos</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points</strong>: The Broncos finally found their rhythm against the Bears, while the Jets are still searching for consistency.</li><li><strong>Targets</strong>: Russell Wilson, after his recent form.</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>: The status of injured players, especially Williams from the Broncos, needs checking.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Kansas_City_Chiefs_at_Minnesota_Vikings><strong>Kansas City Chiefs at Minnesota Vikings</strong></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Key Points:</strong> The Chiefs got back to winning ways, and the Mahomes-Kelce duo is looking formidable.
