After barely posting videos in the last year, the YouTuber dropped a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">major video</a> this week where he revealed that he purchased and moved into a new home. We probably don't even have to tell you that it's incredibly luxurious and something straight out of your dreams for you to believe that it is. And knowing David, he's always going big and bold with everything in his life.&nbsp;</p><p>His new digs are definitely a step up from his last Los Angeles mansion. That isn't to say that his previous pad wasn't already top-notch. But, David's latest spot does have an indoor water fountain, a basketball court, a podcast studio, and more ... which basically means there's no reason for him to really ever leave his home. Hello! You can't beat that!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">David Dobrik's new house is out of this world.</h2><p>After only posting two videos in about a year (as opposed to daily vlogging and posting three times a week), David released one that shared exciting news with his fans: He moved into a brand-new house. "House" honestly doesn't fully describe the property as it mostly resembles a castle in our humble opinion.</p><p>Obviously the whole home is just insane based on its size and location. He didn't say which part of LA he's in, but he does have a phenomenal view of the City of Angels and that already says a lot in itself. However, the amenities might be the best part of the whole thing.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-cbeQSR faRvJV"></figure><p>In the video, David shows off that he now has a pool, a basketball court, a movie theatre room, and a wine cellar all under one roof. And he revealed that he included a studio for him and Jason Nash to record their podcast Views. While he was giving a tour of that space, he told fans that with that new area, he'll be able to post more content on YouTube since it is enclosed and controlled.&nbsp;</p><p>He also unveiled some wonky features of his house that you've most likely have never seen in anybody else's home. For instance, he had a drinking fountain (yep, those ones you probably had in your middle school) installed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Unnecessary Inventions</a> inside that doesn't provide water but Hawaiian Punch fruit punch. Yeah, we're freaking out too.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@unnecessaryinventions href=#>@unnecessaryinventions</a><p>i made @daviddobrik that fruit punch water fountain from Mr Deeds. <a title=unnecessaryinventions href=#>#unnecessaryinventions</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - unnecessaryinvention" href=#>♬ original sound - unnecessaryinvention</a></figure><p>That's not all though, folks! Of course it wouldn't be. It's David Dobrik, King of YouTube, we're talking about here. We can't leave out the life-size Iron Man replica suit and the ginormous bed that's no doubt in David's bedroom. Looking for roommates, my friend? Because you can sign us up!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@unnecessaryinventions href=#>@unnecessaryinventions</a><p>Wow @daviddobrik has some really unnecessary things in his new house. <a title=unnecessaryinventions href=#>#unnecessaryinventions</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - unnecessaryinvention" href=#>♬ original sound - unnecessaryinvention</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Natalie Mariduena will be living with him again.</h2><p>David's main assistant, Natalie, confirmed in an Instagram Story that she moved in with the content creator. She took a selfie in the massive living room and said, "New home who dis ?!" Moving into David's new crib wasn't the only exciting thing that happened in her life recently! In his most recent video on his Views YouTube channel, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">surprised</a> Natalie with one of her favorite musicians of all time, Halsey. Her reaction was priceless. We all need a David in our life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma63tcNmm6iaop64brrEsGShp6Wosg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
