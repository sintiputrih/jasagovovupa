In fact, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>, Tory’s lawyers are reportedly denying <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Megan’s injuries</a> were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sustained by him </a>at all, diverting to an alleged argument between Megan, 27, and her former BFF <strong>Kelsey Harris</strong>, also 27. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Buzzfeed News</a>, the incident left “three bullet fragments in Megan’s feet.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Prosecutors also played Kelsey’s interview that she did with cops the night of the incident, which held a lot more detail than her claims of not being able to recall anything during her trial testimony, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. The audio featured Kelsey spilling the tea, including that she saw Tory firing the gun towards Megan Thee Stallion, per the outlet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Additionally, the stunning influencer has been granted immunity <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in the trial</a> as she goes up against her past friend. Here’s what to know about Kelsey, the woman currently testifying in the Tory Lanez trial.</p><h2>Kelsey was once Megan’s personal assistant.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/megan-thee-stallion-kelsey-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Distractify</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kelsey Nicole Harris&nbsp;</strong></a>was not only Megan’s pal…she also acted as a personal assistant for the “Plan B” rapper. She’s a Houston, Texas native (naturally), and the duo met while attending classes at Prairie View A&M University. Per Distractify, they began hanging out more and more after their friendship was featured on the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>stunning musician</a>‘s Hottie World series.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Kelsey is very business-minded, very organized, very on-time,” Megan told <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a> before the incident in February of 2020. “I’m like, ‘You should quit your job and be my assistant.’”</p><h2>She’s an Instagram influencer.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kelsey-Harris-5-things-backgrid-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Fame doesn’t belong only to Megan — Kelsey is an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> influencer in her own right with over 200,000 followers. That may be at least in part to her<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> famous ex friend</a>, but per her social media, she also claims to be the founder and CEO of booking agency KN Management, the founder of AirBnChill, and the founder of Texas night club The Royal Night Life.</p><h2>Kelsey is a mom.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Aside from her business ventures, Kelsey enjoys showing off her little boy <strong>Drayven</strong>, 7 months old. He’s frequently seen on her Instagram account smiling and modeling adorable outfits. Per Distractify, Kelsey shares her little man, who was born back in May 2022, with <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Darien “Dboy” Smith</a></strong>, an exec at 1501 Certified Entertainment. “My handsome man,” Kelsey captioned a sweet <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>September 5 photo</a> of her son, alongside a blue heart emoji.</p><h2>They fell out after the shooting.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tory-lanez-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>According to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>, Megan cut ties with Kelsey because she continued to hang out with Tory after the alleged shooting occurred at a Hollywood party in 2020.&nbsp;“I’m like, ‘Kelsey, as my best friend, why would you meet up with the person you saw shoot your best friend?’” she told the outlet. “She said, ‘Megan, y’all wasn’t answering my calls. My back was against the wall. I didn’t know what to do.’ What the f*** do you mean your back is against the wall? You’re the only person <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in this situation</a> that would clear this up for me.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The rapper continued, leaving no question as to her feelings on the matter.&nbsp;“This girl told me out her mouth, ‘He told me, ‘Oh, thank you for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>not saying nothing</a>. Now let me invest in your business. Let me do this. Let me do that.’ And all I know was, from that day on, she never said nothing else about the whole situation online.” Tory strongly denies shooting Megan.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Shade Room </a>additionally reported that Megan was allegedly upset when Kelsey shared <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a different version</a> of events than Megan’s.</p><h2>She’s a ‘private person.’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kelsey-Harris-5-things-backgrid-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>According to her lawyer, Kelsey is a “private person” who doesn’t really want to speak out about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the traumatic incident</a>. “My client is a private person and does not wish to make a public statement at this time,” Rolling Stone reported the attorney said following a CBS request for comment. “I can assure you that my client has not been paid a dime by any party involved to ‘remain silent.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>But a fan captured a video via Instagram live in which Kelsey seemed ready to share at least something. “This is just the beginning y’all,” she said in part in the reported video, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reposted to Twitter</a>. “I know y’all want me to talk, but this is just the beginning. So, like, when it’s my turn, just know, I’m going to break everything the f*** down and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>we going to see</a> who really look bad in the end.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K4prjSnrBmoJGnv6q%2FjG1wcW5gbINw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
