It's kind of like how I felt graduating from high school. Initially, I couldn't wait for this day to come, only to realize later on how much I'd grow to miss it once it was over. And while we may have <a href=# class=T3D>brand new <i>PLL</i> mysteries</a> to look forward to in the future, no mission will ever feel quite the same as the original.</p><p>Basically, it's the end of an era, my friends — which, as we all know, can sometimes be a very emotional experience. That's why I've taken the liberty of concocting my very own <a href=# class=T3D><i>PLL</i> finale drinking game</a> (for those who are of the legal drinking age, of course), so that we can face these Summer of Answers demons head on, no matter what big reveals come our way. Plus, we need to gear up for that upcoming time jump that's sure to be chock-full of all sorts of changes. Plus, something tells me that by episode's end, we're all going to be in need of a drink or two (or 10). And for more on this crazy season, check out Bustle's <i>PLL </i>podcast, <i>Taking This One To The Grave.</i></p><h3>Take A Drink If:</h3><ul><li>The <i>PLL</i> moms do or say pretty much anything. #squadgoals #spinoffplease</li><li>There's a Red Coat sighting.</li><li>There's a Black Widow sighting.</li><li>Red Coat and A appear onscreen together.</li><li>A creepy mask comes into play.</li><li>The word "bitch" is used.</li><li>Hanna unleashes an epic one-liner.</li><li>Radley gets mentioned.</li><li>Mona knows more than she's let on.
