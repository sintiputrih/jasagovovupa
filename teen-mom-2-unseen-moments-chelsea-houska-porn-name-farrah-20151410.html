Nathan Doesn’t Understand Speakerphone&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While Jenelle and her then-fiance <strong>Nathan </strong>were having one of their signature fights, he demanded that she put him on speaker phone so the producers could film his side of the story. He insisted he knew what his voice sounded like on speakerphone and that she had not, in fact, done as he wished. Finally, one of the producers shouted, “Hi, Nathan!” After a long pause, Nathan declared, “I can’t believe you would film this conversation!” Face palm.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Leah Is Not Living in Beyonce’s America</strong></p><p>After a deleted clip of Leah’s crazy, kid-filled life was played in which her ex-husband <strong>Jeremy Calvert</strong> simply stood there and stared as she tried to wrangle her children, host <strong>Nessa</strong> noted that Jeremy did nothing to help Leah.&nbsp;</p><p>“He always just stands there. It’s the women’s job to take care of the house,” she said, explaining his view of marriage. “That’s okay. I believe that to a certain extent.” Somewhere, Hillary Clinton’s head just exploded.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=316 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Leah Messer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>3. Jenelle Doesn’t Want Yeezy for President</strong></p><p>In a round of rapid-fire questions, the North Carolina native was asked: “Kanye West — genius or jackass?” Her response: “Jackass.” But don’t judge her too harshly. Remember, Jenelle was there at the MTV VMAs during Yeezy’s rambling acceptance speech and presidential announcement.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Everybody Changes for the Cameras</strong></p><p>Leah wasn’t particularly impressed with her ex-husband <strong>Corey Simms’</strong> wife,&nbsp;<strong>Miranda,&nbsp;</strong>in an unseen clip when the new Mrs. Simms dropped off Leah’s daughter<strong> Aleeah </strong><strong>after</strong>&nbsp;therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>“Her whole demeanor changes when cameras are there,” Leah told the group after the clip aired. “When cameras aren’t there she sits in the truck with her arms crossed. When MTV gets there she gets out and goes, ‘Aww, hey girls!'”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=312 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Kailyn Marroquin" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Kailyn mirrored that sentiment, noting her ex <strong>Jo Rivera</strong> does the same thing.&nbsp;</p><p>“When I have Isaac every other week, I don’t hear from Jo,” she said. “He doesn’t call me, text me, none of it.”</p><p><strong>5. Chelsea’s Telling Porn Name</strong></p><p>During Kailyn’s rapid-fire questions, she was asked what her porn star name would be. Before she had a chance to answer, Chelsea shouted “Farrah!” prompting all the girls to giggle at the reference to Teen Mom OG star and adult film actress, <strong>Farrah Abraham, </strong><strong>and give their own potential names</strong>. Not wanting to ruffle any feathers (or G-strings) Kailyn settled with “Britney Spearhead.” &nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=294 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Chelsea Houska" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>6. Producers Intervened to Help Jenelle</strong></p><p>After Nathan was taken away in handcuffs during one episode, the MTV producers turned the cameras on themselves in a deleted scene, breaking the fourth wall in order to protect Jenelle from further domestic abuse.&nbsp;</p><p>“He told me he thought I was going on a date,” Jenelle explained of why Nathan physically hurt her.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jenelle, that doesn’t even matter, that doesn’t justify him attacking you,” producer <strong>Alexis</strong> said.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t know when or how he gets out, but I don’t think you should be here,” another producer named <strong>Larry </strong>added. “Even if you have to be in a hotel for a day or two, just so you and Kai are safe.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>7. Leah Models Her Love Life After Country Stars</strong></p><p>Could Leah’s final concert have foreshadowed the end of her marriage? When asked what show she saw last, the West Virginia native noted she’d gone to see <strong>Miranda Lambert</strong> and <strong>Blake Shelton</strong> before they’d split. She later added that she’d want to swap lives with <strong>Faith Hill</strong> “because <strong>Tim McGraw </strong>is fine!”</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> What did you think of the Teen Mom 2: Unseen Moments special?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuenZ5iurC5jGtkrqajmrKvecyopJ6mpKh6pLTEpaqemV2dvLa%2Fyppkqaeio3qvrcyeZJ%2BZoqeuqXmRaWhuaWRmfXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
