He gained significant attention in 2013 after being charged and convicted of the murder of Odin Lloyd. He was also accused of the double homicide of Safiro Furtado and Daniel de Abreu, but was found not guilty. However, the day after that verdict, on 19 April 2017, Hernandez took his own life in Shirley Jail, Massachusetts.</p><p>So, how much was Aaron Hernandez worth? According to the latest estimations, sources state that his net worth was as high as $8 million. In 2010, he signed a seven-year contract with the New England Patriots for $39,582,000, including an annual salary of $5,654,571, $15,950,000 guaranteed sponsorship, and a $12,500,000 signing bonus. However, he could not access this salary while his status was inactive, as all guarantees were voided due to conduct detrimental to the best interests of professional football, among other reasons, as stated in his contract.</p><h3>Aaron Hernandez’s Net Worth: $8 Million</h3><p>Aaron’s father, Dennis Hernandez, and his uncle, David Hernandez, were known as sports stars in the local area of Bristol when they were young. However, they were also allegedly involved in crime but became strict fathers, placing importance on education and athletic abilities. As a student at Bristol Central High School, Aaron Hernandez was the Connecticut Gatorade Football Player of the Year. While at college, he played for the Connecticut Huskies football team and later became a member of Urban Meyer’s Florida Gators football team, where he played two years starting from 2007. In 2009, he won the John Mackey Award, the First team All-American Award, the First Team All-Sec Award, and the BCS National Championship.</p><p>Aaron Hernandez was certainly a promising player who decided to continue his career professionally. In the NFL Draft of 2010, he was chosen in the 4th round, picked under the number 113 by the New England Patriots, where he played until 2012. During his short career, he was named Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week in 2010, became AFC Champion with the team in 2011, and was listed as 77th in the NFL Top 100 List. He played 38 games in three seasons, with 175 catches and a total of 1,956 yards, his appearances somewhat restricted by injuries.</p><p>Aaron was accused of killing a friend, Odin Lloyd, in 2013 and pleaded not guilty, but was arraigned; he was found guilty and received a life sentence. Subsequently, Aaron Hernandez’s character was removed from Madden NFL 25 and NCAA Football 14 video games. His name was also removed from football facilities and various locations at the University of Florida. Puma and CytoSport canceled their contracts with the player.</p><p>In 2013, the trial which accused Hernandez of murdering Safiro Teixeira Furtado and Daniel Jorge Correia in 2012 began. Hernandez was additionally charged for attempted killings associated with gunshots fired at other surviving passengers in the vehicle, and armed assault. He was found not guilty of all these charges. However, the following day, Hernandez was found hanged in his cell, on 19 April 2017. Authorities apparently had no indication that Aaron was suicidal.</p><p>In his private life, since 2007, Hernandez had been in a long-term relationship with Shayanna Jenkins.
