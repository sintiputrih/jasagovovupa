See, we’re so worried about staying warm that the last thing on our minds is looking cool. With Mother Nature a minute away from dropping a blizzard on Us, it’s safe to say we have bigger problems on hand — like surviving the storm! So what’s a fashion lover to do?</p><p>The simple solution is a smart-yet-sleek pair of shoes that will weather the elements and still look major — just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">like these</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Timberland-Jayne-Boots.jpg><p><strong>Grab a pair of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Timberland Jayne Waterproof Teddy Fleece Fold Down Boots </a>(originally $160) now with prices starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$110</a>, available at Zappos!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Now, we know what everyone is thinking: “What’s so special about these boots?” The hesitation is understandable, so we think it’s best to let the countless reviewers do the talking on why the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Timberland Jayne Waterproof Teddy Fleece Fold Down Boots</a> are life-changing.</p><p>One reviewer couldn’t get over how “warm and durable” this boot was and called the “waterproof feature” the icing on the cake!

Basically, on any given day, you can fold it up or wear it down for two very distinguishable looks — one which is totally on trend thanks to the fuzzy lining. In reality, it’s the ultimate two-in-one!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TimberlandReplacement2.jpg><p><strong>Grab a pair of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Timberland Jayne Waterproof Teddy Fleece Fold Down Boots </a>(originally $160) now with prices starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$110</a>, available at Zappos!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>One reviewer loved how she could tuck her “skinny jeans into the boot” and on other days rock them with “other pants rolled up,” while another loved how it kept their “pants dry” during harsh winter weather — which is key!</p><p>Another proud buyer mentioned these shoes offer up “some extra grip” when walking through any treacherous conditions.
