Their conservative way of living even in this day and age has raised many eyebrows. The show follows Barry and Kim Plath, along with the lives of their nine children — Ethan, Hosanna, Micah, Moriah, Lydia, Isaac, Amber, Cassia, and Mercy. With the exception of Ethan and Hosanna, who both live elsewhere with their spouses, the Plath parents and their children live on a farm in rural Georgia, where their kids have grown up largely sheltered from the outside world, which means limited technology, limited computers, no video games and a lot of religious boundaries.&nbsp;</p><p>Rebellion in the family started with Moriah Plath who wanted to chart her own path. She writes her music and spends time with brother Micah, and occasionally boyfriend Max Kallschmidt. In this week's episode, as the couple takes time off from their regular lives to explore the woods, Moriah expresses how she has never been encouraged to attend college.&nbsp;</p><p>The Plath kids have been homeschooled and their assignments are looked after by Kim and at times, Barry, whenever he has time to spare. While the little ones and Lydia are adjusting well to it, Moriah seems to often question their decision to not let her go to college. In fact, some fans want her to save money if she really wanted to get to college because it's highly unlikely that her parents will fund her dreams. It's not that the parents don't have money, but they prefer to shelter their kids and keep them tucked away from all the good, bad, and ugly of the real world.</p><p><strong>What's Kim and Barry's net worth?</strong></p><p>Although an accurate number is hard to confirm, a article reported that the couple's net worth is at $3 million. Their TLC show salary is not known but there's a good chance they earn quite a bit from it given the ratings it's bringing in.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, here's what the fans have to say about Moriah's college situation.</p><p>"If Micha moves to Miami, I think Moriah needs to go live with Ethan and Olivia. Save her money for college. #welcometoplathville," one user tweeted, while another shared: "Why is it such a bad thing for a girl to go to college and major in whatever she wants?#WelcometoPlathville."</p><p>"It’s infuriating that Moriah’s mother wouldn’t encourage her kids to go to college when she went her damn self. She’s a terrible person," a user wrote. "#WelcomeToPlathville I went to a militant strict Christian school but this show is even beyond me. What kind of 1950s backwards crap don't want their girl going to college for business?!" another expressed.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I went to a militant strict Christian school but this show is even beyond me.
