Make sure you set your new Lean-TO as your respawn point by interacting with it and clicking the “Set as Respawn” option.&nbsp;</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4d686f5b0a45b38d7d7ce44dbe2ea347?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Aidan O'Brien</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Aidan O'Brien has been playing games for over three decades and has been writing about them for five years.
