Although acne scars naturally get less noticeable over time, there are a number of treatments you can use to speed up the process. Once the salons open back up there are special procedures that can transform your skin, and in the meantime, there are lots of products you can use at home.</p><p id=eQZAUG9m3-0P data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Kate Middleton has an easy skincare beauty hack everyone can try - and it's really cheap</a></strong></p><h2>What causes&nbsp;acne scars?</h2><p id=e2HAi3rl62Um data-wc=62>"Acne scars are caused by a chain of events starting with pores that are filled with bacteria, oil and dead skin cells forming pustules or papules causing the follicle wall to expand and burst," says celebrity facialist <a class=hm-link href=#>Kate Somerville</a>. "Your skin then goes into repair mode and produces new collagen fibres that help heal the compromised skin, oftentimes leaving&nbsp;hyperpigmentation and uneven texture."</p><p id=ej-rXaGZEl1i data-wc=94>But before deciding on which treatment route to go down, it's vital to know the difference between a scar and a mark so that you can treat the skin properly. The difference between these can be surprisingly subtle.&nbsp;An acne scar will be white in colour and the skin will be dented whereas a mark, that has not yet scarred, will be red and irritated in colour. A mark can also be light to dark brown which is a sign of Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH). It's a scar once the skin has gone pale.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to get rid of acne scars</h2><p id=e6nn-ccvaYIQ data-wc=51>Don't panic - there are several ways to get rid of acne scars at your disposal. From preventative measures to everyday beauty treatments you can incorporate into your routine and one-off facials worth splashing out on, we've got you covered.&nbsp;Here are the best ways to get rid of acne scars...</p><h3>1. Prevention</h3><p id=e_UzKDUh3-Tx data-wc=124>Ideally, you want to combat acne right from the beginning, and prevent any further scars from forming. "To clear breakouts, first focus on reducing stress," says a skin expert from skincare brand <span><a aria-label=dermalogica class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Dermalogica</a></span>. "This is a top trigger because it can stimulate excess oil production and hormonal fluctuations, as well as impair the skin's ability to heal. Secondly, establish a regular skincare regime that targets the main contributing factors of breakouts: excess oil, excess dead skin cells, bacterial growth, chronic inflammation and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (this is what causes those stubborn post-breakout marks)." Look for products with Salicyclic Acid (this helps clear away dead skin cells) like <span><a aria-label=serum class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Dermalogica's Age Bright Clearing Serum</a></span>, £58.50,&nbsp;<span><a aria-label=clay class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Bentonite or Kaolin Clay</a></span> (to reduce excess sebum), <span><a aria-label=oil class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Thymol</a></span> (to reduce sebum and breakout-causing bacteria) and <span><a aria-label=niacinamide class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Niacinamide</a></span> (to help fade post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d854c87b9902-dermatalogica-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eC9-Il_A3bMC data-wc=6><strong>Dermalogica AGE bright clearing serum, £58.50, <span><a aria-label=dermalogica class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Feel Unique</a></span></strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label=dermalogica class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=enVX1MntuF-l data-wc=48>Secondly, it's imperative to use daily sun protection. Even minimal exposure to UV light can counteract the strictest of brightening regimes because when a hyperpigmented area is exposed to UV light, more melanin production is triggered, causing further darkening. So get your SPF on! We like <span><a aria-label=moisturiser class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">CeraVe Facial Moisturising Lotion SPF25</a></span>, £12.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Microneedling</h3><p id=eMUkx3La_gx3 data-wc=46>Provided it's carried out by a professional, microneedling can be one of the most effective ways to combat acne scars. The act of microneedling, also known as skin needling, causes micro-wounds, which forces the skin to produce new, healthy collagen and elastin, which reforms the skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=eyQDO1WhhjtB data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:</strong>&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Stars who have overcome acne and how they did it</a></p><h3>3. Exfoliation&nbsp;</h3><p id=eEDnkN1of5u0 data-wc=75>Exfoliation won't get rid of the scars completely, but they can make a difference with mild acne scarring, by means of resurfacing the skin. "If you're noticing a difference in texture due to acne scarring, using an exfoliant twice a week at home may help as it sloughs off the dead skin cells," says Kate. "Make sure to nourish skin after." Look for products containing AHAs (like Glycolic acid) like <a aria-label=acne class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Kate Somerville ExfoliKate Intensive Exfoliating Treatment</a>, £21, or <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>REN's Ready Steady Glow Daily AHA Tonic</a>, £27.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/59baf5d68d03-katesomerville-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eZd6QPZnym4H data-wc=7><strong>Kate Somerville ExfoliKate&nbsp;Intensive Exfoliating Treatment, £21, <span><a aria-label=exfolikate class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Cult Beauty</a></span></strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label=exfolikate class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><h3>4. Skin peels</h3><p id=eQXtM3VpV29- data-wc=78>During a chemical peel, concentrated chemicals are applied to the surface of the skin to remove scar cells and let new ones grow. One of the&nbsp;best types of peels for treating acne scars is a phenol peel, which penetrates deep into the layers of skin beyond the epidermis. Thanks to its potency, Penol peels must be carried out by professionals only. Before you choose the clinic and professional, do your research to make sure they are&nbsp;reputable.&nbsp;</p><h3>5. LED facials</h3><p id=ec5bPA3OEojL data-wc=93>Light therapy has multiple skin benefits and recent research suggests that red LED light may help with cell repair, meaning skin can recover more effectively following a breakout. <strong><span><a aria-label="light salon" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">The Light Salon</a></span>,</strong> based in London, specialises in LED facials which are excellent for helping mild to severe adolescent and adult acne. Non-invasive, red&nbsp;light destroys the bacteria causing blemishes and&nbsp;speeds up the healing process of irritation which improves the overall condition of the skin. With zero downtime and prices starting from just £35, it's one of the best things you can do for irritated skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=elBeucrj3JFz data-wc=36>Fancy a home LED facial? This bargain Amazon mask promises visible results in just one week. Use for 10 minutes a day over The course of&nbsp;12 weeks to see&nbsp;acne inflammation reduced and breakouts banished.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7693ed296d31-led-face-mask-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=enRJKhwgfwsS data-wc=4><strong>LED Face Mask,&nbsp;£24.99, <span><a aria-label="led face mask hangsun" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Amazon</a></span></strong></p><p style=text-align:center id=e0th_SSGXn5g><span><a aria-label="led face mask hangsun" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></p><h3>6. Vitamin C&nbsp;</h3><p id=eeK4uny6Xd9ce data-wc=45>Vitamin C is proven to fade dark spots, as well as provide protection against environmental aggressors so that further dark spots are prevented, and should be a firm fixture in your skincare regime. We like <span><a aria-label=skinceuticals class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic</a></span>, £140, or <span><a aria-label="the ordinary" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">The Ordinary Vitamin C&nbsp;23% + HA Spheres&nbsp;2%</a></span>, £4.95, for a more budget-friendly option.&nbsp;</p><h3>7. Retinol</h3><p id=eaOgR1T7E91Fy data-wc=50>Retinol, Vitamin A, is one of the most useful tools we can have in our skincare arsenal - and its effective for acne scarring, too. By increasing the rate of cell turnover, retinol helps to reduce any hyperpigmentation that occurs post-breakout. Try <span><a aria-label="elizabeth arden" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Elizabeth Arden's Retinol Ceramide Capsules Line-Erasing Night Serum</a></span>, £47.44, for a non-irritating, yet potent formula.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/da1a99aed59d-elizabeth-arden-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ej-mIJuF417Fr data-wc=9><strong>Elizabeth Arden's Retinol Ceramide Capsules Line-Erasing Night Serum,&nbsp;£47.44,</strong>&nbsp;<span><a aria-label="elizabeth arden" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Amazon</a></span></p><h6 style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="elizabeth arden" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><h3>8. Laser treatment</h3><p id=eiePtFwcGOnoC data-wc=64>Laser treatment can be an&nbsp;effective way of repairing damaged skin. The<strong> Pixel CO2 laser</strong>, which costs £450 per treatment, creates small microscopic indentations in the skin, which then stimulate new collagen production. Only opt for laser treatments after consulting with a specialist, as the results will depend upon your skin condition. You will find clinics around the country that responsibly offer the service.</p><h2>How to get rid of acne scars naturally</h2><p id=eUgSLhGo3EGwN data-wc=66>If you can't afford to splash out on a fancy cream or facial, there are a few simple home remedies that might help fade&nbsp;scars. These natural products are known for their healing properties and can work wonders in helping reduce the appearance of marks and calming skin. Although highly acidic, lemon juice is said to reduce discoloration and even out skin tone if used sparingly.</p><ul><li>coconut oil</li><li>aloe vera</li><li>honey</li><li>lemon&nbsp;juice</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/648ad901d0a5-aloe-vera-gel-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eRk_VHNWHbPZp data-wc=5><strong>Aloe Vera Gel two-pack, £6.49, <span><a aria-label="aloe vera gel amazon" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Amazon</a></span>&nbsp;</strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="aloe vera gel" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p style=font-size:12px id=eI4WDl0iPKY0b data-wc=41><a class=hm-link href=#>FAQ page</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKqkoZ6YrrOxjJqlnWWWp66ovsCnmp6rX2d9coSPcGpqbmBsgnh7x6iuZqyfYrSmwIyroJ1ln5t6oq%2FNnmSsm5GnwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
