His first major role was on the Ryan’s Hope daytime soap opera, where he portrayed Rick Hyde from 1984 to 1987. Grant’s appearances on television attracted the attention of producer Aaron Spelling, who felt he had star potential and decided to cast him as Jake Hanson on a few episodes of the famous series Beverly Hills, 90210 in order to spin off the character as the lead in his next series Melrose Place.</p><p>During his time on Melrose Place, Show also appeared on an episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Laura Leighton. In 1997, Show, Laura Leighton (an off-screen girlfriend of Show’s for a period), Doug Savant, Courtney Thorne-Smith, and Marcia Cross left Melrose Place, which led the show into a major decline. It was canceled two years later, though Show later regretted his decision to leave, despite his dislike of the scripts during his final season.</p><h2 id=h-grant-show-dynasty><span class=ez-toc-section id=grant-show-dynasty></span><span><span data-darkreader-inline-color>Grant Show Dynasty</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2012, Grant appeared in the film The Possession, directed by Ole Bornedal, alongside Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick.
