The Baton Rouge rapper talked about his upcoming album Don’t Try This At Home, in which he promised to “speak crazy” — in spite of his recent “Stop the Violence” crusade, in a clip from his most recent appearance with the Rap Radar Podcast.</p><p>YoungBoy declared, “I’m going to talk wild on there. I’ll demonstrate Murda Man for you. I’m going to talk wild on there, but I want to make sure you know not to do this at home.</p><p>He went on to explain that most rappers aren’t as tough as they portray themselves in their lyrics and that the reality of street situations is sometimes extremely different from the entertainment element of it.</p><p>Don’t misunderstand me; many of the individuals you’ll meet today are absolutely who they claim to be, said YoungBoy. “I have no doubts.

Just seeing someone with an alternative attitude that had nothing to do with business or money was great; these people were lovely beings.</p><p>In order to “make sure” YoungBoy’s “heart was in the proper area” for his official baptism into the church, the missionaries started paying the rapper’s house daily visits and having conversations with him about The Book of Mormon.</p><p>Once his house detention is ended, he stated that he intends to be baptized into The Church of Latter-Day Saints. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">NBA</a> YoungBoy said in another section of the interview that his recent interest in religion has helped him write some of his new songs with less harsh lyrics.</p><p>He asked himself, “What if they don’t like me now?” regarding his supporters’ opinions on his fresh strategy. “I won’t be altering. I won’t get angered, I won’t be hurt, and I won’t revert to my previous behavior. Accept it or not, I won’t be returning.</p><p>Both conversations were conducted after YoungBoy released I Rest My Case, his first album of 2023, which experimented with less harsh themes. After selling 29,000 copies in its first week, the album debuted at No. 9 on the Billboard 200.</p><p>Since being declared not guilty in his federal gun case back in July, YoungBoy has released nine projects in little over a year, with I Rest My Case being his ninth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaKCZpXqpu89opZuZXa68trrGm6ayZaOWxrR5x6iuZqCVYrCiuoytnKWkXZ6zbq2Mq5ipqJWneqq%2FjKucmqScrnqorc2gqq2ZX2aGeYCPaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
