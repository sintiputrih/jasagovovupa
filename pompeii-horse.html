The animal was killed in a flash when the nearby Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D.</p><p>The horse was found lying in its stable in the Villa of the Mysteries, a luxurious ancient homestead in a Pompeii suburb that overlooks the sea and once belonged to a high-ranking Roman military official. The estate was originally dug up early in the 1900s but has since fallen victim to burglary (though officials hope it can be restored and reopened to the public).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-203172 alt="Horses Inside The Stables" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/inside-the-stables.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-203172 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Cesare Abbate/ANSA Via AP</span><span class=caption-body>The bodies of several horses side-by-side in their stables.</span></p><p>Massimo Osanna, the director of the archaeological site, <a href=# rel=noopener>reported</a> that they believe the horse to have belonged to that high-ranking military official. The horse was saddled up in a harness of wooden and bronze trimmings and archaeologists believe that the animal was being prepared to help rescue fleeing Pompeians from the eruption.</p><p>Additionally, the horse is believed to have been well-groomed and outfitted in rich metals. It was found alongside several other horses who also perished violently right there in the stables as a result of the eruption.</p><p>The horses would have died via suffocation under the ash or boiled from the inside out due to the extreme temperatures of the surrounding volcanic vapor.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-203173 alt="Horse Skeleton At Pompeii" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/horse-skeleton-pompeii.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-203173 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Cesare Abbate/ANSA Via AP</span><span class=caption-body>A skeleton of a military horse.</span></p><p>The horses and stables are but one of many treasures recently uncovered in Pompeii.</p><p>Last year, the discoveries at Pompeii included <a href=# rel=noopener>an ancient erotic fresco</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>a gilded shrine</a>, and a <a href=# rel=noopener>graffitied inscription</a> in an unfinished building that suggests a different date for the eruption than previously thought.</p><p>Researchers also came to the gruesome realization last year that the excruciating temperatures from Mount Vesuvius must have <a href=# rel=noopener>boiled the blood and exploded the brains</a> of many of its victims, as evidenced by consistent cracks in the tops of victims’ skulls.</p><p>Next up, check out this gallery of <a href=#>Pompeii’s bodies frozen in time</a> Then, check out the discovery of this <a href=#>40,000-year-old foal</a> found perfectly preserved in the Siberian permafrost.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyxu8ypnKKhXZ28s7%2FE</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
