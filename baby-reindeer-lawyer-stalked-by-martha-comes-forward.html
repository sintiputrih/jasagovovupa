Some of the girls in the office were shaking and upset and thought she was going to attack me or some of the other staff. Eventually, she was escorted out, still calling me vile names, and was later spotted circling the office in her car.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer’s ‘real’ Martha denies stalking Richard Gadd: ‘I'm the victim here’" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/cbd6a2c58f7a-martha-baby-reindeer.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer’s ‘real’ Martha denies stalking Richard Gadd: ‘I'm the victim here’" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Baby Reindeer’s ‘real’ Martha denies stalking Richard Gadd: ‘I'm the victim here’</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer: what Richard Gadd has said about the real ‘Darrien’" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8d249b39eb2c-br105unit00203rt.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer: what Richard Gadd has said about the real ‘Darrien’" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Baby Reindeer: what Richard Gadd has said about the real ‘Darrien’</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ep-vJ1rUn2Bk data-wc=42>‘Martha’ then began following Laura, who had started a course at the University of Strathclyde, into her lectures, but the university did nothing at the time.
