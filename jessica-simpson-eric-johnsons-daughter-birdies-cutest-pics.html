Her kids helped out with the social media gender reveal.</p><p>“This little baby girl will make us a family of five,” the fashion designer wrote alongside a September 2018 Instagram photo of Maxwell and Ace admiring dozens of pink balloons. “We couldn’t be happier to announce this precious blessing of life.”</p><p>The couple were <a href=#>“surprised but overjoyed” about Simpson’s pregnancy</a>, a source told Us exclusively at the time.</p><p>Another insider added, “Jessica and Eric are over the moon. They are so happy and very excited. It’s fun because Ace and Maxwell are at an age where they understand what it happening. They are really cute waiting for their baby sister.”</p><p>Simpson shared sweet shots of the older siblings visiting the infant in the hospital and has documented Birdie’s early days ever since.</p><p>After Birdie’s birth, <a href=#>Johnson was a “super dad,”</a> a third source told Us exclusively at the time, adding, “[The kids are] also very helpful and sweet with the baby. They’re both very curious and like to be involved.”</p><p>When it comes to disciplining their trio, the athlete is “the disciplinarian,” Simpson told Us exclusively in May 2018. “If my daughter asks for a dog, she gets one, and then Eric finds a way to make the dog not end up in the house.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Two years later, the fashion designer praised her husband via Instagram in honor of their sixth wedding anniversary.</p><p>“Eric Johnson, my Husband, I love you,” Simpson gushed in July 2020. “Six yrs ago today I married my perfect soulmate. Our unity was written in God’s sky of colliding stars. Together, we manifest dreams, nurture desire and hold space. Destined, it always has been and always will be, forevermore. Also anyone who knows me at all knows that this crystal butterfly is my dream gift.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the Open Book author’s photos of her youngest child over the years, from hanging out in the snow to smiling for full family photos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a%2F0qKammWjnrqxv86nZJ6qmZh6q7vHp6qopqNisaLBxqGrnqpdl7azsMieqmabpamytMCMqaCcq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
