The chamber event saw some amazing moments and matches, one of them being created by Street Profits member Montez Ford. Now, we have an update on Ford’s reported injury at the event.</p><p><a href=#>Click here for our complete coverage of WWE Elimination Chamber</a></p><p>Montez Ford was a part of the Men’s Elimination Chamber match last night. The physically grueling match was contested for the WWE United States championship, with the champion Austin Theory defending his title against five other competitors.</p><p>Austin Theory, Montez Ford, and Seth Rollins were the final three competitors in the match. When Rollins knocked Ford out with a Stomp, Theory snatched the pinfall off Ford. Montez was still lying on the ground as the game went on, and the referee eventually called for officials and medical personnel to attend to him.</p><p>The Street Profits member was led out of the Chamber, <a href=#>which gave Logan Paul the opportunity to enter the chamber.</a> Paul would knock Rollins to the ground, and then finish him off with a Stomp so that Theory could secure the victory-clinching pin.</p><p>Montez Ford is doing well, according to Fightful Select, and the injury angle was created to facilitate Logan Paul’s admission into the Chamber. In the same vein, Paul praised Ford <a href=#>on Twitter</a> following Elimination Chamber.</p><p>““Montez Ford the real mvp.”</p><p>Furthermore, WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H also acknowledged Montez Ford’s performance in the chamber match <a href=#>on Twitter.</a> He did after failing to mention him during the post-Elimination Chamber press conference.</p><p>“Missed mentioning at the press conference… But @MontezFordWWE is a STAR. #WWEChamber.”</p><p>Check back at<a href=#> Ringside News</a> as we follow up on this story.
