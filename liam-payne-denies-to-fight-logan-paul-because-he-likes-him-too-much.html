The rapport between the famed musician and popular youtuber was pretty strong during the entire podcast. Liam takes a liking to Paul and would rather fight the brother Jake Paul if he comes down a few slots.&nbsp;</p><p>Liam Payne gets candid about his “unstable” desire to fight people. Joking that he is unstable to a certain degree, the English popstar thinks hard on who he might have a bout with.</p><p></p><p>“I’d enjoy the challenge. I’d enjoy the road up to whatever else,” Liam agrees he would relish the challenge to smash someone’s head in. Payne admits he is up for a fight against KSI upon being asked if he would fight him. Logan Paul urged him on to not fight KSI,” You don’t wanna fight him.</p><p>Liam replied to host Logan “I’d fight him”. Logan remarked that apparently KSI doesn’t have it in him to fight the popstar. Liam is all over the tabloids for taking digs at Justin Bieber. The British musician wouldn’t fight Justin Bieber cause he is not on his level. Albeit he did appreciate <a href=# rel=noopener>Just Bieber</a> for his skills. Furthermore. he also impersonated Pirates of the Caribbean’s main character Captain Jack Sparrow to compare Justin’s pretentious personality.&nbsp;</p><p>Liam’s relationships have gone haywire recently and the news reporters haven’t missed the opportunity to increase their TRP.&nbsp; Allegedly dating American tv personality Aliana Mawla has ignited old rumors about ex fiancé Maya Henry. Aliana takes a strong stance regarding breaking off Liam and Maya. She denies her being the reason for the split rather strongly. It seems to be going to be strong between Aliana and 28-year-old One Direction band member.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmpaGRonqxrdinnGaclaO2pr%2BMraZmnpmctbV5y6iemqZdpa62uIybnJyZpaiybrTEZqOio5Woeqm1zGarqKddosKktI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
