In one of the interviews, she shared private information regarding the affair telling how he fed her chocolate-chip cookies when they were listening to Bryan Adams ‘Everything I Do, I Do It For You’. Both José and she agreed that the statements were all fake.</p><p>Then, in the year 2010, another controversy took place after a Kenyan woman named Lelesit Silvana alleged that she had an affair with Mousinho when he went to Diani.
