My girl knows she’s my #1 gal.”</p><p>In the photo, Heather is hugging <a href=#>stepdaughter Taylor</a>, 13, whom husband <strong>Tarek El Moussa</strong> shares with ex-wife <strong>Christina Hall</strong> (née Haack). Tarek, 42, and Hall, 40, also share son Brayden, 8, while Tarek and Heather <a href=#>welcomed baby Tristan</a> in January 2023.</p><p>Heather’s Instagram Story post came after the <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a> alum received backlash from Instagram followers after seemingly leaving her stepdaughter out of a <a href=#>Valentine’s Day</a> social media post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Heather-Rae-El-Moussa-Responds-to-Haters-With-Photos-of-Stepdaughter-Taylor-01.jpg><p>“Happy Valentine’s day to my boys T, T & B ❤️👼🏻 I have never felt so much love in my life,” Heather captioned a series of photos on Wednesday, February 14. “All 3 keep me on my toes but I wouldn’t want it any other way. I am so thankful to have you as my husband my best friend and my partner @therealtarekelmoussa.”</p><p>She called Tarek — whom she wed in 2021 — her “person” and “the best daddy.” Heather’s caption concluded: “I love you very much honey and I love you Tristan and Bray❤️.”</p><p>The comments section was immediately flooded with people wondering why Heather left her stepdaughter out of the post.</p><p>“You can wish a girl happy Valentines too. Sad to just say the male kids,” one Instagram user wrote. Another asked, “Is the stepdaughter chopped liver on vday?”</p><p>A third commented, “I cannot believe you chose to alienate Taylor on Valentine’s Day. That is SAD.”</p><p>While Heather didn’t respond to any comments, the Thursday Instagram Story post with Taylor appeared to be a response in itself. (Heather and Tarek coparent Taylor and Brayden with Christina, who wed <strong>Josh Hall</strong> in 2022.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Heather previously spoke about the “strong relationship” she has with her stepkids during <a href=#>an exclusive interview</a> with Us Weekly in June 2023.</p><p>“I don’t favor any of the children more than the others. <a href=#>They’re all important to me</a> and I love them so much. And I wouldn’t be a mommy if I didn’t have Taylor and Brayden,” she said at the time. “The truth is we have them 50 percent of the time and I don’t see them as much. And when we have them, we are busy. I’m not thinking about taking photos and videos … we have sports, we have tutoring, we have a strict bedtime.”</p><p>She added, “People don’t understand my relationship with Taylor and Brayden. It’s OK. I know my strong relationship with them and how much we love each other, and I know what a devoted stepmom I am, and that’s all that matters.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGahnZGptaa%2BjKuYnmWVoXquu9SsqpploprAsbvNnapmrJ9itaLAxGaZsmWgpMCqusZmrqKsmGLAtbHPnZiun5ipsrN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
