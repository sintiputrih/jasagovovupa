Jacob is the youngest child of the duo, who split in 2016. They are also parents of 30-year-old twins <a href=#><strong>Zach</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Jeremy</a></strong> and 27-year-old daughter <a href=#><strong>Molly</strong></a>.</p><p>The network responded to Jacob’s post in a statement to Us Weekly on Wednesday, December 16: “TLC was just informed about an alleged encounter that occurred years ago involving a third party connected to the production of Little People, Big World. We are saddened and troubled by this very serious allegation, and TLC will work cooperatively with the authorities. Our main focus remains on supporting the Roloff family during this very difficult time.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p>Jacob went on to question the “physiological” effects of reality TV before thanking his family, writing, “It must finally be emphasized that all fault lies with the predator, and no fault lies with any of my family members. I am certain that this is a positive moment for me, and another step toward a brighter future.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>His wife, <a href=#><strong>Isabel Sofia Rock</strong></a>, reposted his message via Instagram Stories. “It goes without saying that I am incredibly proud of my husband right now,” she wrote.</p><p>The twosome wed in September 2019.
