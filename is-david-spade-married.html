Whenever people list off what they’d like in a life partner, many times a “sense of humor” or “funny” is at the top of the list for most desired qualities.</p><p>That’s why it makes so much sense that famous comedians have dated some of the most beautiful Hollywood actors and models. Funny guy <a href=#>David Spade</a> is no exception to that. David was one of the most well-known comedians in the 1990s after he first appeared on Saturday Night Live. David’s successful and lengthy career has helped him to earn a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> estimated at $40 million, but does he have a wife to share his fortune with? <a href=#>Has David ever been married?</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">David Spade has never been married, but he has dated quite a few ladies.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranker</a>, David has dated an impressive 20 women but has never tied the knot with any of them. The comedian once admitted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s very hard for him to settle down</a>, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t thought about it or actually tried.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He told The New York Times, "It's very hard for me, for various reasons, which we won't get into. Too much data, too many gigabytes. But I have been trying to do that. I've known someone for a long time. I've been trying to make something work."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">David Spade’s list of ex-girlfriends is long and blonde.</h2><p>David has dated numerous actors and celebrities, including Heather Locklear, Lara Flynn Boyle, Julie Bowen, Teri Hatcher, and Naya Rivera, just to name a few. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>E! News</u></a> actually called him "a bachelor-era George Clooney of the comedy world” after photos of David and Naya cuddling in a swimming pool went viral. His friends concur that he has got a way with women.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Howard Stern, on his radio show while discussing the dating reports, said that David was simply that charming of a guy, one who's always had success with the ladies.</p><p>In 2016, David was seen out with Baywatch's Charlotte McKinney. Their outing caused a lot of speculation and rumors, but nothing was confirmed. A few years later, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he admitted that he was still single.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That being said, David had another daring confession. "I’m dating someone now,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>. Unfortunately, he didn't really give any additional details, so fans are still left in the dark about if its that serious and who the mystery person is.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">David Spade has a daughter with a Playboy bunny.</h2><p>David shares custody of his daughter with her mother, a former Playboy bunny named Jillian Grace. The two broke up shortly after Harper was born. She was born in 2008.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>David said that having a daughter of his own has truly changed his viewpoint on his own father and he revealed in his book, A Polaroid Guy in a Snapchat World. He stopped talking to his father after Harper was born.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">David spilled his true feelings about fatherhood in his tell-all book.</h2><p>David explained more about his dad and wrote, “This one's going to be a little tricky — this is a chapter about my dad, and the way that it fits into this audiobook is I'm a dad now. And the difference - and why it caused some complications with my own dad — is because he was sort of a ne'er-do-well, which is putting it mildly. I think f--k up is more on the nose.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He continued, “So when I had [Harper], I got this new tidal wave of resentment towards my dad because of his irresponsible behavior and manipulative mean streak. So I stopped talking to him.”</p><p>It’s still a mystery as to if David will settle down with anyone, but he remains a dedicated father and one of the best comedians in his craft. Fans will just have to wait and see.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBusMCvoJ1lo6WupbGMppirqpmasQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
