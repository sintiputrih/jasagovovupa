Four years earlier, Daus’ fiancée, Grace Holland, died by suicide. Daus’ connection to both women has led some to wonder if he could be involved in their deaths.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>In 2020, Daus reported his fiance, Holland, 35, shot herself in front of him, depressed about a recent miscarriage. “She was depressed. We lost a baby. It’s the second miscarriage, and she was very depressed, and I didn’t want to try another round,” <a href=#>Daus reportedly told officers</a> at the time. Holland’s death was officially ruled a suicide, something her family denies.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>About four years later, in Jan. 2024, 39-year-old Dr. Sarah Sweeney, Daus’ girlfriend, died suddenly in Daus’ home. As of this report, Sweeney’s death was under investigation, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">toxicology and autopsy results were forthcoming</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Holland family’s wrongful death lawsuit</h2><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Before Sarah Sweeney’s death, Grace Holland’s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Robert Daus, alleging mental and physical abuse and that Daus either shot Holland or encouraged her to take her own life. Text messages later revealed Daus and Holland’s relationship issues.</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>The Holland family suit also cites inconsistencies in the case, such as Holland reportedly shooting herself in the left temple when she was right-handed and a missing engagement ring. In Dec. 2023, about a month before Sarah Sweeney died, the wrongful death suit was referred to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Missouri prosecutors</a> to determine if any criminal charges against <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daus were warranted</a>.</p><h2 id=h-the-sudden-death-of-dr-sarah-sweeney data-injectable=false>The “sudden” death of Dr. Sarah Sweeney</h2><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Uncertainty surrounding Grace Holland’s death aside, according to Sarah Sweeney’s mother, Teresa Sweeney Light, her daughter lived with two medical conditions, one of which can cause fatal anaphylactic shock if not treated. Her daughter, however, carried an EpiPen for safety, she said. Sweeney’s family never met Daus, and they were aware of the Holland case, but when they sent Sweeney news reports about what happened to Holland, Sweeney stopped responding.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Referring to the investigation into her daughter’s death and the lack of communication from Sweeney about Daus’ history, Light told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a>, “She was a grown adult, a doctor, and a woman. We didn’t know what to do … We just wish we could have her back … We just want closure, we want it to be truthful and fair, and as of right now, we’re still in shock.”</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Beast</a> says that in light of Sweeney’s death, St. Louis County police have now called Holland’s suicide a “suspicious death,” and her case was active. Daus has never been named a suspect in the Holland or Sweeney case and has denied any involvement in either death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX2l6urHAq6pmal2ZsqKwjLCmpp2eYq5uucisqqitop56p7XRnp2in5ipsrO%2FjJyfoqScnruoedaemWanlmKwsLrNnpqtoZ%2BjwG6x16mjmqGemrFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
