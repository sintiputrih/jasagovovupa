Although they couldn’t have a ceremony that day, they did tie the knot in their backyard with their <a href=#>friends and family watching via Zoom</a>. This time around, they planned a big wedding at The Steam Plant in Ohio with the help of Pink With Envy event planning — and then had to cancel again.</p><p>“We had pushed back to December 20, thinking we’d be in a better place. Then on December 1, our governor <a href=#>placed heavier restrictions</a>. No dancing and no food stations (which we can understand) and after that, I couldn’t imagine having 100 guests just sitting at their tables from beginning to end. It’s not what I envisioned,” the Biggest Loser trainer, 33, told Us Weekly exclusively. “Being a pandemic bride has taken a lot of fun out of planning!”</p><p>However, the bride and groom, 42, — who got engaged in December 2019 — still wanted to marry and their venue was available on December 12. So, they invited their parents, siblings and kids to watch them finally be able to <a href=#>celebrate their love</a>.</p><p>“When I was diagnosed with stage 2 thyroid cancer [in 2018] and called to tell him, the first thing Danny said was, ‘OK, we are getting through it.’ We hadn’t even been dating a year and for him to say ‘we’ as in ‘together’ meant a lot,” Lugo told Us about knowing McGeady was The One. “He was with me every step of the way and made me feel loved and beautiful even during that tough time.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The wedding took place on Saturday in Ohio, her hometown, surrounded by 25 guests. The wedding party was tested before the ceremony and isolated beforehand. All guests stayed 8 feet apart during the reception along with wearing masks.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery for the exclusive photos of the ceremony and reception.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr6qzxp6qrWWcpMCmvtJmnKuhk5Z6rcHGqGSdmZ6jxm65wqCcmpypqHq4scOdoKefXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
