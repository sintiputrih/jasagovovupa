So, they’ve no idea when they’ll actually walk the aisle. However, they did have plans to hold a grand wedding.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“So this is sort of our fun time out in Hollywood for the first time. It was very surprising and meant to be, but about time. I’ve finally grown up enough to get married,” Maria shared after a week of getting engaged.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, the actress added that they were “really excited about this new chapter.” Being with Dominique, doing the same things she was doing, but this time, together with her partner, Maria didn’t want anything more.</span></p><h3><b>When Did Maria Bello And Dominique Crenn Begin Dating?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Maria Bello and Dominique Crenn began dating between late 2018 to early 2019.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Shortly after the pair started seeing each other, Dominique was then diagnosed with breast cancer. She then tried to warn Maria what her cancer would mean for their relationship. But the actress wasn’t letting anything come between them. “She’s like, ‘I’m here and I’m going to be here for all the time during the time of this’ and she’s been by my side. She’s been there for us,” Dominique explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In response, Maria then added, “Listen, I just knew. I just knew and so did she. I’ve never smiled as much as I have this last year.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Maria didn’t hesitate to mention that you really learn how someone rolls when they’re sick.

However, they only revealed the news about their engagement in February 2020 while coupling up on their way to Elton John’s annual Oscar party.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“We’re pretty happy, considering that we just got engaged,” Bello revealed to Entertainment Tonight reporter Lauren Zima at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dominique beat cancer and was doing well the last we checked.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Dominique has admitted to being open to loving someone of any sex.</span></p><h3><b>Have Dominique Crenn And Maria Bello Adopted Daughters?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dominique Crenn and Maria Bello do have their respective children.

You are kind, brilliant, conscious and curious. You are the example of a true free human, i love you more than you know. You are my best friends and you both teach me humility. You are what matters in this world. I love you Charlotte and Olivia.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Maria, she has a son named Jackson from her relationship with screenwriter Dan McDermott.

Well, she’s happy enough with her “non-biological” kids.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in 2018, when a man called her out for missing “the very important role of being a mother to children,” she just replied, “If you have kids, I hope you stay home with them, so that your wife can go out and be a bad-ass woman.”</span></p><h3><b>Dominique Crenn Dating History</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dominique Crenn dated Katherine Keon before Maria Bello.
