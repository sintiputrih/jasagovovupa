Gabriella’s mind is set on winning the Miss Connecticut USA title like her mom did in her early 20s, but is she focused enough to take the crown?</p><p>Another pair of newbies is Eva and Sunnie from Houston, Texas. <a href=#>This close-knit mother-and-daughter</a> relationship involves bizarre routines such as shaving each other’s armpits and giving each other facials down there.</p><p>The show also features India, 59, and her son-in-law Trevor, 37, from Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>This odd pair wears matching outfits and eats from each other’s mouths. India even has dentures made from a mold of Trevor’s mouth so that they’ll have the same smile!</p><p>Their closeness is especially disturbing to Trevor’s pregnant wife and India’s daughter, DeLeesa. She gives her husband an ultimatum: It’s either her or her mom.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sky, a choreographer, dancer, and singer, and her 19-year-old daughter Skylar are connected at the hip.</p><p>Sky once had dreams of being the next Beyonce, but now the momager has her sights set on catapulting Skylar to superstardom no matter what.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mother-daughter-duo-kathy-and-cristina-are-back-for-another-season>Mother-daughter duo Kathy and Cristina are back for another season</h2><p>Kathy, and Cristina from Norridge, Illinois, are back for another season, and the larger-than-life Italian duo is still as close as ever.</p><p>Kathy is turning 65 this year and fears her life is about to end, so she wants a unique birthday party at a funeral home.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cristina is concerned that her mom might be battling a health issue and is scared to find out the truth.</p><p>Another familiar duo, Mary and Brittani from Florida, has taken up synchronized hobby horsing as exercise.</p><p>Their close-knit relationship is threatened when Brittani’s boyfriend TJ comes into the mix, but Mary is convinced he is not the right guy for her daughter.</p><p>Little does she know that Brittani and TJ are keeping a secret from her.</p><p>Smothered premieres Tuesday, December 12 at 10/9c on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6OivLW0xKucnWWimsG2vs2sZJ%2BnomLApq3SqKVmbV2strW0jJ%2Bmrqpdo7K4ecOupqxlk52ypLeMqKytZaSdsm7A0ZqgpZ2iZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
