Literally coming back from the dead to clear this up.<p>The official reason the English dub was recast was NDAs the 4Kids actors had. If you've ever seen how the current voice actors for the show can't do their voices at conventions and the like, the same was true for 4Kids actors, and is standard across any voice actor's NDA. 4Kids was not allowing voice actors to use their character's voices in non-4Kids approved productions, which included Pokemon S9-onward.<br>NDAs also last for a period of time, in case for 4Kids two-three year periods. So for 2006 to 2008, if a voice actor from 4Kids did their Pokemon voice on S9-onward, they effectively were breaking it. Notice how<br>1. James Carter Cathcart and Kayzie Rogers are not in any 4Kids productions past this. James was recast from being Vector too in the Sonic series.<br>2. In 2008, most voice actors returned including Maddie, Marc Thompson, Dan Green, among others. Yes this is in tandem with DuArt taking over but it's only a coincidence.</p><p>It's pretty clear cut, unfortunately the drama of 2006 was hectic at the time and lots of misinfo spread around. I'd say these days there isn't a lot different from 4Kids to TPCi in terms of casting, think how many reprisals we've seen in Journeys alone. Hope this helps, now back to the grave I go.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHylu8aaqq6rXZeupLfPmpqkZZSewKTB0qygqKZeaH5xgI9op5qflWJ%2BeIM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
