The only regret I’d have had would have been wrong marriage but it still helped me to be who I am today. So, I don’t have even one regret. I am a proud mother of four lovely boys.&nbsp; I have also had lots of challenges in Nollywood. Some producers will tell you that if you don’t sleep with them, you won’t amount to anything in the industry. I was asked to have s3x with them in exchange for movie scripts many times and I did not do it! It is not something you come to say somebody did this or that to you.”</p><p>Onyinye Okafor in a recent interview monitored by Kemi Filani, also criticized her mates in the movie industry&nbsp;who air their personal grievances in public, particularly on social media.</p><p>She said: “He or she who feel that washing his/her dirty linen outside is best, should continue. For me, Onyi Okafor, it’s not my thing. I let you see what I want you to see. You cannot know too much about me because I’m not comfortable with that.</p><p>It is crazy and it’s not a good idea. I don’t know why people do such stupid and crazy thing. It’s not my thing. When I see things like that, I just pass like I don’t want to see it.</p><p>Except for death threat, every other thing should be about you. Like what you see on my page is me, I am the public person. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqJkq52Xp7K1ecaeq62hnpx6rq3Rq6CenF2WsLW%2BxKyqZqeerravxcRmpqSZlqS%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
