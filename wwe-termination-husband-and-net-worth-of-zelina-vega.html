In 2011, wrestling magazine Pro Wrestling Illustrated named Zelina Vega “Inspirational Wrestler of the Year.”</p><p>Furthermore, all of the controversies have put a halt to her wrestling career after she was finally allowed to demonstrate her talent as a wrestler after primarily working as a manager. How did it happen that WWE’s valuable present and future are no longer with the company?</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Zelina_Vega_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Zelina Vega?
