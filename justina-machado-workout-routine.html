She next appeared in the TV film No One Would Tell. In 1997, she made her big screen debut in the movie She’s So Lovely. At the same time, she played recurring role Raquel Delarosa in the show Goode Behavior. In the 2000s, she became further known for her role as Vanessa Diaz in the HBO series Six Feet Under.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-901 data-method=placement-service></span><p>She also played Sunny Estrada in the series Missing.

Though she admitted that she took dieting and working out too hard when she was younger, she now feels much more accepting and confident of her body. But it doesn’t mean that she doesn’t stick to healthy habits anymore because she still does. It’s crucial not only for the weight thing but for her general well-being. Talking about how she keeps herself fit and healthy, she said:</p><p>“When I was in my 20s I used to go crazy. I used to work out two or three hours a day like cycling, I was never anorexic, just picky. When I was in my 30s I’d go back and forth, now that I’m 41 I’m like whatever man! For the most part, I just do a regular workout. I have a trainer and that’s about it!”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><h3 class=related_post_title>Related Posts</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwKrGxKxlnKedZLe2v9OipZplnZawqa3DqGSwp6KgvLbAjKumrqyZo7Jw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
