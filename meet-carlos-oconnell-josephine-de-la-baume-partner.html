Since then, the two musicians have made their romance IG official, and now, they are expecting their first baby!</span></p><p><span>Keep scrolling to learn more about Joséphine de La Baume’s partner.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Carlos O’Connell, Joséphine de La Baume Partner & Baby Father</b></h3><p><span>Carlos O’Connell first met Joséphine de La Baume back in 2020, thanks to their mutual profession. Instantly, falling for each other, the musicals then officially started dating and also went on to walk multiple red carpets together.</span></p><p><span>Just in the year 2022, the couple attended the “Anatomy of a Scandal” premiere and also the Cosmos event by Kate Moss event.</span></p><p><span>Now, as of December 2022, the lovebirds are pregnant with their first child. The news about their pregnancy first came through Carlos’ IG where Joséphine showed off her bump in a stunning maternity shoot for L’Officiel magazine. The post was captioned, “Blessed with a year of surprise and beauty. on to the next: chapter 1.”</span></p><p><span>Prior to Carlos, Joséphine was married to Mark Ronson for 5 years. The former husband-wife tied the knot in 2011 in Aix en Provence, in the South of France. Sadly, their marriage came to an end in 2018, a year after they filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split.</span></p><p><span>After their split, while Joséphine went on to date Carlos, Mark moved on with Grace Gummer. The DJ proposed to Meryl Streep’s daughter in May 2021, and they exchanged vows in August of the same year.</span></p><p><span>Just 2 months before Carlos and Joséphine announced their pregnancy, Mark and Grace also confirmed theirs at W Magazine’s 50th-anniversary party in New York.</span></p><h3><b>Carlos O’Connell Age</b></h3><p><span>Carlos O’Connell was reprtodlty born in 1994. That would make him 28 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>Also, he would be 10 years younger than his baby mama Joséphine if that’s true.</span></p><h3><b>Is Carlos O’Connell Spanish?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, Carlos O’Connell is Spanish. He grew up in Spain, in Madrid, in a family with both Spanish and Irish cultures. “In the house, there was a mixed upbringing, all the Irish traditions, and all the Spanish ones,” he explained.</span></p><p><span>It seems Carlos went to school in Spain but also went to Ireland every year. So, although he’s Spanish, he feels more connected with the Irish. But it’s not just because of his roots but also because he feels Irish has a deep appreciation for music, “much more than your generic Spanish family,” he remarked.</span></p><p><span>Further comparing the two cultures, he said, “There’s not the kind of value for the arts in Spain in that kind of way, anymore. Music was a thing I did since I was a kid, and I needed to explore Irish roots. As soon as I turned 18 I left Madrid and went to Dublin. It all worked out, I suppose.”</span></p><p><span>Carlos now doesn’t sound Spanish at all, he has a very Irish tone. However, he used to sound more Spanish when he moved to Spain. And it still comes out when he drinks too much. “And it’s strange now when I speak in Spanish; the English vowels have crept into my Spanish-ness. It takes me a few weeks to adapt to the language when I come over to Spain,” he explained.</span></p><p><span>Also, because of his accent, people assume that he’s Irish.</span></p><h3><b>Carlos O’Connell Family</b></h3><p><span>Carlos O’Connell comes from a family of at least four. His dad, Carlos is from Spain, and his mother hails from Dublin.</span></p><p><span>According to the star, his parents met after his mother moved to Spain in her 20s, trying to find a job. Thereafter, the duo fell in love, got married, and raised Carlos and his sibling in the very country.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Carlos O’Connell Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Carlos O’Connell flaunted a net worth of above $1 million in 2022 — all thanks to his musical career.</span></p><p><span>Looking back, Carlos met Conor Curley, Conor Deegan, Grian Chatten, and Tom Coll met in Dublin while attending the </span><i><span>British Institute of Modern Music</span></i><span>. Initially bonding over a love of poetry, the group formed a band named </span><i><span>Fontaines D.C</span></i><span> in 2017 and began self-releasing singles and performing live regularly.</span></p><p><span>Within 2 years, the band then released their album, </span><i><span>Dogrel</span></i><span>, which went on to be listed as Album of the Year on the record store Rough Trade’s website, voted Album of the Year by presenters on BBC Radio 6 Music, and nominated for both the Mercury Prize and the Choice Music Prize.</span></p><p><span>So, what makes </span><i><span>Fontaines D.C</span></i><span> special? As per Carlos, their approach to making music is comparable to the art of sushi. He said, “To make good food you have to eat good food. You have to develop a taste better than the taste of the customer.” Likewise, they’ve refined their taste over the years and will continue to do so.</span></p><p><span>Most of their early songs were inspired by their home city of Dublin. But now as they reside in Longdon, their experience of otherness and alienation has seeped into the music.</span></p><p><span>In case you are interested, their next show is happening at “NGAIO MARSH THEATRE, CHRISTCHURCH” in New Zealand on Jan 27, 2023. Or you may find them at “ROUNDHOUSE, SYDNEY” in Australia on January 2, 2023.</span></p><p><span>Buy their merch at “shop.fontainesdc.com.”</span></p><p><span>Here’s their IG @</span><a href=#><span>fontainesband</span></a><span>, FB @</span><a href=#><span>fontainesband</span></a><span>, and Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>fontainesdublin</span></a></p><h3><b>Carlos O’Connell Height</b></h3><p><span>Carlos O’Connell stands tall at a height of 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Carlos O’Connell Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>His birthday wasn’t revealed.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Carlos O’Connell On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Find him on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>carly_rings</span></a><span>.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Does Carlos O’Connell Live?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>In 2022, Carlos resided in London, UK.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpp2VqXqkrdGlpqxln5i8r7rEpaNmop%2BosrG0yKecZpyVYrmiecGarKadXaWus8DNnqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
