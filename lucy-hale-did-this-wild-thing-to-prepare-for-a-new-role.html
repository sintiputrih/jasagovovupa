Whether you loved her in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Pretty Little Liars",</a> "Truth Or Dare" or "Fantasy Island", there is no denying just how great an actress Lucy Hale truly is. With endless success throughout her career, Hale scored herself the lead role in her newest movie&nbsp;"A Nice Girl Like You".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress plays Lucy Neal, a violinist who was just dumped for being too shy in the bedroom! So, Hale's character takes it upon herself to change that! Well, with a role as wild as this one, Lucy Hale revealed to E! correspondent, Justin Sylvester, that she had to pay a visit to a rather "wild" place in order to study and prepare for her role. Where did she have to go? We're talking all about it, now!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lucy Hale Loves Being Single... But She Still Swiped Right On John Mayer</a></span></p><h2 id=a-nice-girl-like-you>A Nice Girl Like You</h2><p>The beloved Lucy Hale, who appeared in the hit show "Pretty Little Liars" as Aria Montgomery, has since taken on a number of roles in both film and television, however, the actress is starring in her newest movie, "A Nice Girl Like You". While the title fits Lucy Hale's personality to the T, it appears as if the film's title is very far off from what transpires on-screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hale revealed that the film follows the life of a woman who has just been dumped for being too vanilla in the bedroom. After having her heart broken, Lucy's character essentially creates a sex to-do list, however, Lucy was quite unfamiliar with many of the things on the list! The star said that she was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">laughing her "butt off" while reading the script</a> and knew that she needed to prepare for the role as best as she could.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lucy Hale Is Better At Beauty Than Baking</a></span></p><h2 id=dedication-to-the-role>Dedication To The Role</h2><p>While her character is someone Lucy has not played before, she ensured that she was ready for the role and did so in a way that might shock you! The actress and a few of her friends&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attended an actual sex convention</a>. Lucy didn't specifically list of everything she saw at the convention, but what she did do is call it "wild". Lucy continued by describing the experience as unlike anything she's ever done before and claimed that she'd witnessed "stuff I'd never seen before".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was definitely a lot for Lucy Hale to take in at once, however, the star knew it was the one thing she had to do in order to prepare for her role. Additionally, Lucy revealed that her motive for attending the convention was also a personal challenge for her as well and ultimately allowed her to step out of her comfort zone and experience something completely different from what she is used to.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lucy Hale and Katy Keene Cast Say Their Goodbyes To The Show</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijrpupYrWiuMRmm6KcXam1qr%2BMsKClnF2ptaq6xmarqGWgp7KxrdGeZJ%2BnomKubrrEsGSrp5yafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
