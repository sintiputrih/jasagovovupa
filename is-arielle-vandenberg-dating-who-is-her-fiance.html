I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for being such cool, loving, funny, crazy awesome parents!” She is also incredibly fond of her late grandparents and considers having grown up surrounded by their love a blessing. “You guys will always and forever be two of my favorite people I’ve ever met in my life,” she wrote about them. Apart from these crucial people, does Arielle have a special love in her life? Let’s find out!</p><h2>Arielle Vandenberg’s Former Relationships</h2><p>Before we get to talking about Arielle Vandenberg’s current dating life, it is important to mention her previous relationships. If reports are to be believed, the actor dated ‘Malcolm in the Middle’ actor and disc jockey Christopher Kennedy Masterson for about a year, from 2008 to 2009. In the same year, she was reportedly linked to Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine for a few months until 2010.</p><p>It has been reported that Arielle was seeing former professional snowboarder Shaun White for a while in 2011. Interestingly, Arielle also got together with Alex Turner, English musician and principal songwriter of Arctic Monkey, in 2011; the pair reportedly parted ways in 2014, after three years of dating. The actor then went on to date ‘BoJack Horseman’ star Will Arnett. The two made their red carpet debut in January 2015 and went on to date for about six months before reportedly splitting up in June of the same year.</p><h2>Arielle Vandenberg’s Fiancé</h2><p>Yes, Arielle does have a special someone in her life — her long-time boyfriend and former Vine partner, Matt Cutshall. After dating for several years, the two put a ring on their relationship in September 2019. Announcing their engagement to their followers, Matt wrote, “It’s been quite the journey with you my sweetheart and I wouldn’t have it any other way.” Matt is a social media comedian and musician who began collaborating with Arielle on comedic skits for Vine. They shared such a great bond and became best friends so quickly that rumors began to emerge about a probable romance.</p><p>Although the two did not comment anything on it in the beginning, Arielle and Matt finally confirmed their relationship on social media in 2017. Since then, the couple has moved from strength to strength, collaborating on many professional ventures such as creating skits, music, vlogs, and hosting podcasts, including the informal comedic podcast titled ‘Riled Up with Arielle & Matt.’</p><p>The two also share similar spiritual beliefs, and Arielle, a believer herself, also mentions how they both pray together and support each other’s dreams. When asked about their ideal date night, Arielle said in an interview that they love to relax and watch their favorite shows and movies. Since they don’t really get much downtime owing to their busy schedules, Arielle said that their idea of a perfect date is to spend some quality time with each other, away from all the attention.</p><p>As far as the wedding bells are concerned, Arielle and Matt have been planning their wedding for quite some time. Unfortunately, it all got delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but things have slowly begun to look up. In a 2021 interview with <a href=#>Pop Culture,</a> Arielle spilled the beans on how filming in Hawaii for season 3 of ‘Love Island’ has made her excited about having a beachside wedding. “I honestly got here [to Hawaii], and I was like, should we get married after we wrap? Just pop over to Maui, get married, send a couple of friends out,” she said.</p><p>Vandenberg further added, “I definitely want [our wedding] to feel the way I feel here, which is so relaxed and so beautiful. Having the ocean next to you while you’re getting married — I feel […] it’s calming, it’s healing, it’s all the things. I feel like it’s definitely going to be an ocean location.” They frequently share their love for each other on social media, showcasing their extraordinary bond and believing to be each other’s soulmates. As the happy couple plans to get married soon, we wish them a lifetime of love and happiness and hope to see more of their love in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmoqtdlr%2BqsculnGaukaOxprrBnqmgZZSWwaq6xmauoaddnsButMSrZJ%2BhkaOwpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
