Lane, played by <strong>Keiko Agena</strong>, went on to fall in love with and marry another bandmate Zack (<strong>Todd Lowe</strong>), and the couple eventually welcomed twins, Kwan and Steve, in season 7.</p><p>However, according to Agena, Lane and Dave’s ending might have played out differently if the show were still airing today.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>E! News</a> published on Saturday, June 29, Agena, 50, revealed she believes that Lane and Dave would have eventually reconnected.</p><p>“As rock ‘n’ roll as she said she was, I think she would be pretty above board. But I think there is some lovelorn, heartsickness over that relationship,” Agena told the outlet. “Maybe some daydreams. I don’t know that she would ever act on anything, but a friendship for sure.”</p><p>Despite understanding fans’ yearning for a Dave and Lane reunion, Agena also noted her hopes that Lane is out there “traveling” while still married to Zack. “Because she was such a fan of music, in my mind, I always craved more out of Connecticut interaction for her,” she said.</p><p>Of the potential storyline, Agena added that Lane is probably “writing really bad fantasy fanfiction” as she explores the globe, which eventually “becomes a concept album that [musician] <strong>Bjork</strong> somehow got involved with,” before Lane becomes an international star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Gilmore-Girls-Alums-Adam-Brody-Keiko-Agena-Reunite-003.jpg><p>Agena added that if Gilmore Girls were to be rebooted, after attracting a legion of fans when it aired from 2000 to 2007, she would certainly return for more. Agena attributed the show’s creator, <strong>Amy Sherman-Palladino</strong>, with keeping the cast — which featured <strong>Alexis Bledel</strong> and <strong>Lauren Graham</strong> as mother-daughter duo Rory Gilmore and Lorelai Gilmore — inspired.</p><p>“Amy’s so talented that if she was excited about an idea and if she had a way that she wanted to tell some of these stories, if people were available, I think everyone would be interested in finding where these characters are now,” Agena told the outlet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Almost 10 years after the original series aired, Netflix released a four-part revival series, titled Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, in November 2016, which saw most of the cast back in their original roles.</p><p>While no further onscreen reunions appear to be on the cards, Graham, 57, was seen hanging out with <strong>Kelly Bishop</strong>, who portrayed Lorelai’s mother, Emily Gilmore, just last month.</p><p>In a photo shared by the Parenthood alum via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Friday, June 28, the former colleagues were seen posing for a selfie while wearing big sunglasses. “Here’s to the ladies who lunch,” captioned Graham.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6ipJ2kv6Z5xqKppatdoLKqt85mmKCdnpZ6tK3YrGSlmZ6aeqexxKWqZqSfq7Ktu9GnZKiulad6pa3VnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
