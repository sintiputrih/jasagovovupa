According to <a href=#>11 Alive</a>, the Georgia Department of Revenue accused the pair of evading state taxes from 2008-2016. The state resolved its case with the Chrisleys in October 2019 after Todd and Julie paid $147,944.75 as part of a settlement. They were also refunded $66,000.</p><p dir=ltr>Todd has always been vocal about denying the allegations against them. In March 2021, <a href=#>the reality star spoke about the legal woes</a>&nbsp;that he&nbsp;and his wife were at the center of on his podcast, <a href=#>Chrisley Confessions</a>. The reality star shared that he would update further in April 2021 but did admit that there was "lying, cheating, stealing, [and] manipulating" going on with the Georgia Department of Revenue. "We have made the decision that we're going to sit back now, now that the work is done," he shared. "We have the things that we believe will shed so much light on that situation."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>Distractify</a>, the pair still faces federal charges brought to light in August 2019. The charges include "commit bank fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and tax evasion." According to the report, they failed to file income taxes in 2009, 2011, and 2012 and the IRS alleged that they submitted false financial statements to banks to receive millions in loans for their own personal benefit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHBkZ4Rxe9OrmKChk2KxpsDAoqOsZZGXvLbAjK2fnmWTnb%2Bqv8uesGaekaK2rcWO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
