It’s important to keep in mind, though, that they are going through a stressful time. Not everything that you want to say or ask will be helpful to them. The first thing you should avoid saying is anything along the lines of “the market is bad.” They know this.

If they haven’t mentioned that they’ve bought a house, it’s likely they haven’t yet. Don’t remind them of their struggle by asking. Lastly, resist the urge to ask them about loans or mortgages.
